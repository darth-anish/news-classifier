suffered, but now it is worth it. This is the only way it could have been,\" she said.\n","The context of that suffering is all the more evident now in the wake of Rubiales' kiss of Hermoso, which the 81 national players said was a sign of the challenging environment they have had to deal with for many years.\n","\"The players have always deserved better, but there were too many working against them,\" journalist Olmeda explained. \"This is a first step towards hope, but it cannot be the last.\"\n","Edited by James Thorogood\n","'Brazil: Lula adds Bolsonaro supporters to Cabinet 07.09.2023'\n","Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday announced a Cabinet reshuffle that will bring into his government two ministers who were once allied with his political rival and predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.\n","Andre Fufuca was named as the sports minister and Silvio Costa Filho will be the new ports and airports minister, said the Lula government in a statement.\n","Both the lawmakers used to hold key positions in the far-right Bolsonaro administration, which governed from 2019 to 2022.\n","\n","The move is being seen as a tactic to shore up support for Lula's political agenda from a powerful bloc of lawmakers.\n","The president also created a new portfolio for small- and medium-sized enterprises that increased the number of ministries from 37 to 38.\n","The latest announcement also seals the entry into Cabinet of the party of lower house speaker Arthur Lira, who was a supporter of Bolsonaro.\n","The reshuffle was preceded by a series of negotiations between the government and Centrao, a group of center-right parties characterized by their support for whichever party rules the Congress.

It's still possible, though it appears increasingly unlikely, that the suspended president return to his post.\n","Vilda had already been a figure of controversy after 15 players last year staged a mutiny calling for him to quit or be forced out. They had cited inadequate coaching methods and called for conditions to match those of the men's squad.\n","The footballers also complained of Vilda being too strict and micromanaging them — to the point of telling senior players what they should say in media interviews.\n","While some of the demands were met, most of the players involved were cut from the squad and Vilda received strong backing from Rubiales.\n","Rubiales eventually found himself with a diminishing number of supporters, although his mother did stage a brief hunger strike in a church in southern Spain, denouncing what she perceived as injustice against her son.\n","The coach of Spain's men's national football team, Luis de la Fuente had also applauded Rubiales' refusal to quit and his tirade against \"false feminists.\"\n","De la Fuente apologized on Friday for having clapped, describing it as an \"inexcusable human error.\"\n","The Spanish men's team on Monday joined in the criticism of Rubiales' actions.\n","\"We want to reject what we consider to be unacceptable behavior from Mr. Rubiales, who has not lived up to the institution he represents,\" captain Alvaro Morata said in a  statement on behalf of the team.\n","rc/msh (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)\n","'Bayern Munich and Rwanda: Sponsorship causes criticism 05.09.2023'\n","There are almost 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) between Munich and the Rwandan capital Kigali. They are different worlds in many respects, but a new sponsorship deal should bring them closer together.\n","The state tourism campaign Visit Rwanda wants to attract more tourists to the East African country by advertising with Bayern Munich, as it has done before with Arsenal FC and Paris Saint-Germain. How many millions will flow from Africa to Germany for this purpose by 2028 is unknown. However, the premium partnerships tend to cost in the ballpark of €5 million ($5.3 million) per year.\n","Jan-Christian Dreesen, Bayern's CEO, defended the partnership at the European Club Association (ECA) meeting in Berlin on September 7. \n","\"Yes, we take money from Rwanda, but we also do something for it; by being open about it, by sending coaches there, by building a youth academy together, and so on,\" he told DW. \"We want to be part of the development of Rwanda and also champion Africa as a continent of opportunity.\"\n","However, human rights campaigners see it rather differently.\n","\"A very, very bad choice,\" said Wenzel Michalski of the NGO Human Rights Watch, referring to the human rights situation in Rwanda. Critics, including journalists, are threatened and silenced, he said. Furthermore, there have been reports of arbitrary abductions, torture and unexplained deaths.\n","The politically active Munich fan scene, in which Christian Nandelstädt is well connected as a club member and blogger, have been similarly shocked by the German record champion's new deal. \"We reject this,\" he told DW in no uncertain terms. \n","In Kigali, opinions differ about the multi-million dollar image-building campaign. The accusation is that the regime of ruler Paul Kagame is engaged in sportswashing and wants to use the campaign to divert attention from the abuses of freedom of the press, democracy and the fight against poverty.\n","For journalist Gonza Mugangwa, former secretary general of the Rwandan Journalists' Association, this aspect is obvious but not at all decisive. \"What really worries most Rwandans is whether it's worth investing these sums,\" he told DW.\n","Of course, people are proud when their country is so prominently represented, he said. However, he is skeptical whether the income from these deals also helps the average citizen to improve their financial situation.\n","\"That would be the case if income came from tourism and could be directly linked to these sponsorships,\" he said. In practice, however, this is difficult, which is why he \"does not yet see any dividends in direct sponsorship relationships with the clubs.\"\n","Bayern fan Charles Ndushabandi from Kigali, on the other hand, tells DW he is optimistic: \"I'm sure that Rwanda as a brand has gained more recognition since these contracts were signed. Not only in Africa, but also in Europe and Latin America because these football clubs are big and watched by millions.\"\n","Many in the Bayern fan scene aren't impressed by the decision. After the end of the much-criticized partnership with Qatar Airways, there had been \"a few weeks of bliss,\" Christian Nandelstädt said, \"and now this!\" Once again, he said, business is being done with an autocratic state, once again a contract has been signed for five years.\n","\"It's hard to understand why. The club is swimming in money,\" he said. According to him, protests in the Munich Südkurve [where the most loyal fans gather to watch the games - the ed.] are to be expected again. He's dismissive of the argument of promoting talent used by the club to justify its commitment. \"For that, they would have had to get involved in another, more democratic country in Africa.\"\n","It is probably no coincidence that Rwanda, of all places, is now being considered in Munich. President Kagame maintains close contacts with Qatar, right into the circles of the ruling house. Moreover, Qatar Airways, the former sponsor of Bayern, is one of the biggest players in the African country. The Qatari airline holds almost half of the shares in the state-owned airline RwandAir and has a 60% stake in Bugesera International Airport, which is currently under construction.\n","Talking to foreign observers in Kigali, it also becomes clear who is most likely to reap the rewards from the international money flows and the fairly high rates for tourists. The economy is largely in the hands of the ruling party, the RPF. Moreover, the much-vaunted economic upswing is concentrated only in the capital. Clean streets, glittering glass facades and other amenities, such as a golf course designed by PGA legend Gary Player, await visitors there.\n","In less urban areas though, poverty still reigns, while floods in May exacerbated the hardship. The millions that are now flowing into the Bundesliga could also be put to good use here.\n","The road to the top European leagues is long, even for youngsters who go through the extremely performance-oriented system of youth academies in France or Germany. In this respect, the new deal does not tear down any walls.\n","At best, it slightly opens the door for Rwandan football talent.\n","That's echoed by sports journalist Jah d'Eau Dukuze, who produces one of the leading sports programs in Rwanda.\n","\"The sponsorships already have an effect. For example, the cooperation with PSG was important for the development of young players who would like to become professionals.\" Young footballers between the ages of 12 and 15 have been to France twice to compete with their peers, he told DW. \"It's a rare opportunity.\"\n","Creating such opportunities — away from the million-dollar deals — is now Bayern Munich's job.\n","This article was translated from German.\n","\n","\"Spain: World Cup win and Rubiales' kiss may reshape football 05.09.2023\"\n","Two weeks on from Spain's triumph over England in the women's World Cup, young players training in the fading heat of a late Friday afternoon at CCF Olympia Las Rozas — a team located just north-west of Madrid — are evidently still basking in the afterglow.\n","\"It means a lot for us as football players, because now the world puts us on the map,\" 23-year-old midfielder Lucia Fernandez told DW. \"It's very important for us and for the little girls coming through, because now they have a reference, which is something that we didn't have in our time.\"\n","Moreover, as her teammate 18-year-old Marta Buendia explained to DW during warm-ups, something about this World Cup just felt different. \"There was much more support around,\" Buendia said. \"Usually only the Americans watch (women's) soccer.\"\n","\n","Buendia is right as proven by the record-smashing TV viewing figures. In Spain, close to 6 million watched the final, while in England more than 12 million tuned in at peak audience time. Match ticket sales in traditionally football-ambivalent host nation Australia also massively outstripped the target of 1.5 million, to the delight of FIFA.\n","In fact, a report published last month by the world football governing body hailed improving professional opportunities and commercial prospects as well as a huge increase in the number of women and girls playing organized football: almost 25% since 2019, reaching 16.6 million worldwide.\n","The historic win should be good news for the women's game in Spain, translating into more interest and more financial support, CCF Olympia Las Rozas sports director Ana de la Chica said.\n","\"What we have shown with what we have achieved here is that if you invest in women's sport, you always get good results,\" the 38-year-old said.\n","In short, it's a good moment for women's football in Spain. Except for the elephant in the room.\n","There is one topic no one at CCF Olympia Las Rozas wants to discuss: Luis Rubiales, the disgraced president of the Spanish football association (RFEF) and the kiss he foisted on player Jenni Hermoso during the award ceremony. She quickly made clear it was not consensual, but Rubiales maintains that it was and has flat out refused to resign.\n","Facing investigation into whether the incident amounts to sexual assault and suspended by FIFA, the 46-year-old's position is looking increasingly untenable. Initially, the Spanish FA rallied around him, accusing Hermoso of lying and threatening to sue her. Last Monday, the same organization called for Rubiales' resignation, saying he had \"seriously damaged the image of Spanish football.\"\n","With a huge social media backlash, condemnations from prominent footballers and dozens of street protests staged, Nadia Tronchoni, sports editor-in-chief at Spain's El Pais newspaper, believes it is only a matter of time before Rubiales is stripped of his power for the long term.\n","He still has some defenders, Tronchoni told DW, many of them in the male-dominated Spanish football association. Not to mention his mother, Angeles Bejar, who announced a hunger strike to support him last week.\n","For the World Cup winning team, problems go much deeper than one man's behavior at the World Cup final. They are about structural inequalities and a fractured relationship with now former head coach Jorge Vilda, who was let go on Tuesday.\n","For years now, many of Spain's top women players have called for more respect, money and staff to be committed to their game. They say they want greater professionalism from the RFEF and salaries that reflect their status as athletes.\n","Late last year, 15 players indicated they would not represent the country unless there was change, saying the situation was taking a toll on their health and emotional state. The RFEF under Rubiales sided resolutely with Vilda and condemned the players for \"scheming\" in an incendiary statement that raised the prospect of legal action.\n","Despite the fiery reaction, some positive changes were made, according to Tronchoni. Ultimately three of those 15 players — including Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati — decided to play at the World Cup.\n","Given the simmering conflict, the RFEF president and former head coach's swaggering behavior is even more jarring, she said. \"They made a big exhibition of winning this World Cup.\" \n","Rubiales was also seen grabbing his crotch just meters away from Queen Letizia and her teenage daughter during the final. For Tronchoni, the message from the two men appeared to be: \"It's because we did it, us men too. We warned these girls, we stayed on our feet, and we did what we wanted. And now we won.\"\n","Rubiales views himself as the victim of a manhunt. During his speech to the RFEF — where according to Tronchoni only 6 of the 140 people in attendance were women — he blasted \"fake feminism, a great scourge in our country.\"\n","His actions have touched a nerve well beyond the world of football. On Friday evening, protesters gathered in several Spanish cities, including Madrid, organized by a left-wing student group. Demonstrators at the capital's Puerta del Sol plaza held up signs reading \"down with rape culture\" and \"resign!\"\n","\"We're basically calling him out, telling him 'please go', because right now what everyone's talking about is not the great triumph for the champions of women's football. They're talking about this man,\" a 25-year-old named Isabel told DW.\n","The widespread condemnation, which even sawfar-right party VOX slam his behavior, although also decrying a left-wing \"political and media hunt\" against him, can be read as a sign of change.\n","\"The best thing that this unwanted kiss has done was show us that society has understood feminist culture,\" Tronchoni said. The backlash against Rubiales was natural and quick, according to the sports journalist. \"The country is a lot more feminist than it was five years ago.\"\n","The question is whether this will also change the women's game. After Rubiales' speech, when he stressed five times that he would not resign, more than 80 of Spain's best women players, including all 23 World Cup winners, announced a strike on representing the nation. And last week, unions representing athletes playing in Spain's top flight, La Liga, announced they could also strike over pay when the season starts this month.\n","What is different now is that the RFEF can no longer simply dismiss the demands made by the women's team, Tronchoni claimed. \"We're going to believe them when they say we need to change, when they say this is not professionalism, when they say we need to be respected. This is not acceptable.\"\n","CCF Olympia las Rozas sports manager de la Chica has witnessed her own team blossom since it was set up in 2015. \"We started with 13 girls and now we have more than 350. And after the World Cup win, the telephone has been ringing and we have even more.\"\n","\"What we are looking for now is the visibility that gets us opportunities and that allows girls to develop in a safe environment with the best possible tools.\"\n","Edited by James Thorogood\n","(\"Bundesliga: Victor Boniface leading Leverkusen's early title challenge \"\n"," '05.09.2023')\n","Victor Boniface's brace in Bayer Leverkusen's win against Darmstadt on Saturday was impressive, but they weren't his first competitive goals at the BayArena.\n","Five months ago, he found the same net when he fired Belgian side Union Saint-Gilloise into the lead in the Europa League quarterfinal first leg. Leverkusen ultimately progressed 5-2 on aggregate, but Boniface had left his mark on the Werkself.\n","\"He's a proper tanker, the weights room must be his best friend,\" commented Leverkusen midfielder Robert Andrich at the time. \"He repeatedly made good runs behind our lines, and his finish wasn't bad either. He's really horrible to play against. I don't know if he does that every week.\"\n","Not every week, but regularly enough, with his 22 goals and 12 assists in all competitions for Saint-Gilloise convincing Leverkusen to pay €16m ($17.3m) for the young Nigerian, a fee which could yet rise as high as €20.5m with bonus payments, despite an injury record which already lists two cruciate ligament tears in the same knee.\n","\"It was a business decision as to whether or not we should take that risk,\" explained sporting director Simon Rolfes after offering Boniface a five-year contract when others, including Bundesliga rivals RB Leipzig had decided not to. \"But, in our opinion, it was worth it.\"\n","And he's been proven right so far as the 22-year-old has spearheaded Leverkusen's perfect start to the season, with four goals and two assists in the first three league games showcasing that he's an all-round powerhouse. Furthermore, he's struck up an immediate understanding with rising star Florian Wirtz, as well as fellow summer signings Granit Xhaka and Jonas Hofmann.\n","\"He has everything,\" former Belgian national team coach Marc Wilmots, who watched Boniface closely in Belgium's Jupiler Pro League last season, told Kicker magazine. \"He's strong on the ball and fast, a real weapon. He fits into any system, either as part of a front two or as a lone striker.\"\n","So far in Germany, it's been the latter. But come October, when Czech striker Patrik Schick is expected to return after undergoing surgery for a long-term groin injury, head coach Xabi Alonso will have even more options.\n","\"Of course, everyone's talking about his goals, but Victor is also important in our build-up play with his presence and ability to hold the ball up,\" said Rolfes after the win over newly promoted Darmstadt. \"When the opposition press, it helps the central defenders to know they have someone who they can play to. That's just as important as his goals.\"\n","Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, happy now to only be facing Boniface in training, summed it up, saying: \"He's a nightmare for any defense.\"\n","Boniface's versatility suits Bayer Leverkusen well this season, with the Werkself looking a much more rounded team under Alonso having reinvested the €55m received from Aston Villa for Moussa Diaby wisely in Boniface, Xhaka and Hofmann.\n","The question now is whether Alonso, in his second season in charge, can build on Leverkusen's shrewd signings and perfect start and mount a serious challenge for the title — or indeed any trophy.\n","Despite exemption from the 50+1 rule and financial backing from pharmaceutical giants Bayer, Leverkusen have only ever won two major trophies in their entire history: the UEFA Cup in 1988 and the German Cup in 1993. Since then, a series of near misses have seen them acquire the disparaging nicknames of \"Vizekusen\" — a play on the German word for \"vice\" — or the anglicized \"Neverkusen.\"\n","In 2002, they famously lost in the finals of both the German Cup and Champions League while throwing away the league title on the final day. In 2020, they were seconds away from going into the winter break top of the league before conceding a last-minute goal against Bayern Munich. And last season, they were ultimately knocked out of the Europa League in the semifinal by Roma.\n","When the Bundesliga returns from the international break, a trip to Munich will offer a clearer barometer of just how good this Leverkusen side is.\n","\"We're not going to go to Munich and defend for 90 minutes,\" promised midfielder Xhaka after the win over Darmstadt. \"We respect Bayern, but we're not scared.

However, in recent months, the northeastern state bordering Myanmar has made international headlines for different reasons.\n","Ethnic tensions spilled over into violence in May, when the Kuki tribal group, who reside mainly on the hills, clashed with the majority Meiteis, primarily residents of the Imphal Valley, on the question of land resources and political representation. Around 160 people were killed, and it was estimated that between 40,000 to 60,000 had been forced to flee their homes.\n","The situation in the state that is home to three million people subsequently quietened, but violence flared again on August 29. According to local reports, 18 people were killed in these latest clashes between the Kukis and Meiteis. \n","There are concerns that Manipur's status as a sporting powerhouse, especially for women's football, could be negatively affected in the long term.\n","With a strong female sporting culture, Manipur's women won the National Women's Football Championship in June for the 21st time out of 26 editions and have consistently kept the national team supplied with talent.  \n","\"Football is the number one sport in Manipur, and men and women have been equal across sports.

Manipur's weather is also favorable for football, as it's colder than mainland India, where the summer temperature is very high.\"\n","\n","The egalitarian culture did not match the image broadcast worldwide in July when a video surfaced of two naked Kuki women publicly paraded by a group of Meitei men. It has been alleged that the women were gang-raped. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the incident had shamed the country and promised those guilty would face justice.\n","\"This video was shared widely on social media, which sparked outrage across India,\" said Achom. \"These visuals of the ethnic clashes in Manipur have contributed to the deteriorating image of the state as a place that is unsafe for women.\"\n","It also makes it harder for girls and women to play football, especially as whole areas of the country are shut down while security forces seek to take control of the situation.\n","\"There are two different regions, the plains and hills,\" Bala Devi said. \"Those who live in the hills can't travel to the plains, and those in the plains can't go to the hills.\"\n","The players at the top levels are still in action for clubs around the country and in national team training camps. \"It is lower down the levels where it may be a problem. It is a concern at the grassroots level and for younger girls who have had their lives disrupted,\" Bala Devi continued.\n","Such concerns could be costly for the state's future as a sporting superpower. \"Training grounds won't be maintained due to lack of funds as the government is busy spending on relief and rehabilitation, and practice sessions will be disrupted by frequent public shut-downs amid the intermittent violence,\" said Achom. \n","\"Players who live in the hills of Manipur won't be able to come to the state capital of Imphal, where sports infrastructure is available, due to road blockades and ethnic tensions.

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic two years ago, the organizers — the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) — completely revamped the former auto show in an attempt to secure the survival of the fair as a \"globally unique mobility platform\" in a new location, namely Munich.\n","The IAA began in Berlin in 1897 and stayed there for 50 years before moving to Germany's financial hub of Frankfurt am Main.\n","Now in Munich for the second year in a row, the IAA wants to be seen as a showcase of \"urban mobility,\" exhibiting \"mobility ecosystems,\" and not merely a single mode of transportation, the automobile. The marketing pitch sounds like an excuse for the absence of many foreign automakers in Munich this year— indeed, more bicycle manufacturers are set to attend, whatever that says about the new IAA's appeal.\n","Quite naturally, the big three of the German automobile industry — Volkswagen (VW), BMW and Mercedes-Benz — have a vested interest in holding the event in their home market. But the list of globally known brands represented in Munich is shorter than ever, with, apart from the German heavyweights, only Renault from France and Stellantis Group's Opel brand.\n","A handful of exotic newcomers to the electric vehicle market like Lucid from the United States and Croatian electric sports car maker Rimac are also present. Vietnam's Vinfast EV company withdrew its participation at short notice, no reason given.\n","In the absence of the auto industry's big whales, some of the small fry are looking to create a splash on the European car market. One of them is BYD — initials stand for Build Your Dreams — a Chinese manufacturer based in the industrial hub of Shenzhen.\n","In China, BYD is an industry whale itself, especially with its battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) that are so successful that BYD last year replaced VW as Chinese market leader by sales. BYD is now building the dream of conquering the European market with its BEVs and plans to showcase six of its models at the IAA.\n","BYD used to be a manufacturer of smartphone batteries, but is now applying the know-how gathered in its early days to produce state-of-the-art batteries for EVs.\n","BYD car batteries do not require nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which makes them less expensive to produce. In terms of software and technical innovations, China's EV makers have also made big strides in recent years, and are now on the cutting edge of digital applications for cars.\n","China-made EVs are still few and far between on German roads — BYD has sold 1,448 cars so far, while VW has delivered 207,000 EVs in Germany. However, experts believe BYD and other Chinese EV makers will be able to win customers in Europe with significantly lower prices for their cars.\n","There is precedence: In the 1980s and 1990s, carmakers from Japan and South Korea were initially laughed at for their cars, but they then steadily increased their market share through lower prices and better quality.\n","\n","Despite the shortage of big names at this year's IAA, exhibition halls are 90% booked, according to the VDA industry group. IAA's design concept has been changed and now includes two separate locations — the main exhibition center for professional visitors and a so-called Open Space in downtown Munich for the general public.\n","BYD said it will showcase its cars at both locations. Perhaps it was this Chinese IAA dominance that made the organizers bend over backward to ensure the presence of the world's most valuable carmaker: Tesla. It is not known, however, why CEO Elon Musk has finally given in to VDA's courting, as Tesla usually prefers to organize its own special events to promote its technology.\n","Tesla, BYD and the German carmakers are currently locked in a fierce battle for bigger shares of the emerging EV market in Europe. After overcoming supply-chain snarls amid the COVID pandemic, German auto giants are back in expansion mode with surging sales and profits in the second quarter.\n","Auto experts predict challenging times ahead, however. \"China is well on its way to becoming an automotive superpower,\" said consulting firm AlixPartners in a note to investors recently, and added that the era of record profits for German manufacturers is \"coming to an end.\"\n","Consultants at EY also sense \"strong headwinds\" for legacy manufacturers in their home markets.\n","As far as the world's biggest car market China is concerned, more than one study predicts domestic manufacturers reigning supreme, with their market share surging to about 65% by 2030.\n","This article was originally published in German. \n","\"Christoph Freund: Who is Bayern Munich's new sporting director? 01.09.2023\"\n","The Austrian, born in 1977, was a player until 2013 but never played higher than the second tier in his home country. In the last few years, he's worked in Red Bull Salzburg's management team, initially as team manager in 2006, then as sports coordinator in 2012 and finally as sporting director in 2015, succeeding Ralf Rangnick.\n","In the eight seasons before his move to Bayern Munich, the Red Bull outfit has been the dominant force in Austrian football, winning the championship eight times and the cup six times.\n","The position had become vacant because Freund's predecessor, Hasan Salihamidzic, was fired along with CEO Oliver Kahn in May, immediately after Bayern's final game of the season, when they narrowly won the Bundesliga championship. The Munich team had experienced a largely unsatisfactory season. After the poorly handled coaching change from Julian Nagelsmann to Thomas Tuchel, the team was eliminated early in the German Cup against Freiburg and the Champions League against Manchester City. In addition, Salihamidzic had failed to manage the succession of top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski satisfactorily. His \"king transfer,\" Sadio Mane, flopped.\n","The 46-year-old has a good eye for talent and is considered a skilled negotiator in transfer deals. During his time at Salzburg, future stars such as Erling Haaland, Karim Adeyemi, Dominik Szoboszlai and many other top talents arrived. Freund also earned RB Salzburg big transfer profits with many players who attracted attention with eye-catching performances in the Austrian league.\n","Haaland arrived from Norway for €8 million ($8.7 million), made just 22 competitive appearances for Salzburg and scored 28 goals, and was sold to Borussia Dortmund for €20 million. Szoboszlai arrived within the Red Bull construct in 2018 for half a million euros from training team FC Liefering and was transferred to RB Leipzig for €36 million after three years.\n","Another example is U.S. international Brenden Aaronson, who arrived at Salzburg from Philadelphia Union for €12.7 million in January 2021 and departed for Leeds for €32.8 million 18 months later.\n","Discovering and nurturing talent is not limited to players, though. Many coaches who shone in Red Bull's Austrian empire are now employed as head coaches in the Bundesliga and other top leagues. RB Leipzig's Marco Rose, Bo Svensson of Mainz and Bochum coach Thomas Letsch currently ply their trade in Germany's top flight.\n","In addition to achieving the greatest possible sporting success, which is taken for granted at Bayern, Freund would like to focus more on youth again. After the era of homegrown stars such as Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Müller and others, talent graduating from the club's academy has become a rarity. The last player to make it into the Bundesliga as a regular from the Bayern Campus, the club's youth development center, was Jamal Musiala — and even he had been at Chelsea for eight years beforehand.\n","\"The biggest challenge will be to develop young players into great players. There is still room for improvement, and the Campus can become even more important,\" the new sporting director was quoted as saying on Bayern's website.\n","But Bayern fans can still look forward to more star signings like Harry Kane: \"We want to bring a few players through from the Campus, but we will also keep bringing in top players,\" Freund promised. \"The important thing is a mix of both.\"\n","This article was translated from German.\n","'Chess and sexism: Can the game be made safer for women? 01.09.2023'\n","\"I guarantee you there is no woman who would say she has never heard a stupid remark,\" Ingrid Lauterbach told DW. The president of the German Chess Federation (DSB) has herself experienced situations where someone wanted to hug her, give her a kiss on the cheek, or worse — without her consent.\n","Lauterbach is an international chess champion and has played in international tournaments for decades. While she has never experienced any physical assault, she knows the typical comments all too well. The chess world, including the DSB, needs to address the elephant in the room — sexism.\n","Chess had its very own #MeToo moment at the beginning of August. Affected women from the world of chess rallied together to write an open letter demanding change.\n","\"We female chess players, coaches, referees and managers have experienced sexism or sexual violence at the hands of male chess players, coaches, referees or managers,\" the letter read. It was signed by more than 100 women from around the world.\n","One of them is German national player Annmarie Mütsch. She recently told German news magazine \"Spiegel\" that she had canceled her participation in important tournaments in order to avoid certain people she would rather not meet.\n","So is chess particularly affected by sexism? Grandmaster and DSB spokesperson Josefine Heinemann doesn't think so. \"Of course, I have been hit on at a chess tournament before and maybe it was a little bit uncomfortable. But I wouldn't classify that as sexual harassment,\" Heinemann said.\n","Situations like those aren't exclusive to the chess environment, she said, they are part of everyday life. It is a problem facing society as a whole.\n","There is, however, one major difference in chess: Women are greatly in the minority, with only 10% of all players identifying as female. Women-only tournaments do exist, but if female players want to challenge themselves at the top level, they have to take part in mixed tournaments to advance their careers.\n","It's also unique to chess that younger women often compete face-to-face against older men, which can cause annoyance if the woman wins. \"There is often a comment, especially when older men lose to younger girls,\" Heinemann said.\n","The grandmaster, however, sees an even greater danger beyond the chessboard. \"From my point of view, there are already a lot of stupid comments on the internet. Some things I read on there leave me shocked.\"\n","The internet provides anonymity, and the inhibition threshold falls drastically. Lauterbach also believes that modern communication channels and chess websites make it easier to communicate with people against their will. On the other hand, the internet also provides a platform for those affected by sexism to fight back.\n","Women no longer want to stay silent. In February, two times US champion and influential chess writer Jennifer Shahade posted on what was then called Twitter, but is now known as X: \"Time's up.\" In her post, she described the sexual misconduct she had allegedly experienced at the hands of chess grandmaster Alejandro Ramirez. \n","Within minutes, many people commented, detailing similar experiences in the past. Among them was a man who confessed he had witnessed Ramirez allegedly assaulting a young woman in 2011, but he didn't think it was an issue back then.\n","By that time, various abuse scandals had already caused uproar worldwide. So how did no one seemingly notice anything in chess? Ramirez says he is cooperating with various investigations and looks forward to giving his side of the story.\n","Were such allegations just all too common in the past?\n","According to German player Mütsch: \"Since I signed the open letter, I've thought more about the incidents I've experienced. I've thought of so many things that I wasn't even aware of before.\" \n","American-Canadian chess player and influencer Alexandra Valeria Botez set up an initiative for an anonymous, international database to collect cases of sexual harassment and abuse in chess worldwide. A reaction she deemed necessary, as no major steps have been taken by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) and except for the Ethics Commission, there is no point of contact for those affected by sexual misconduct. \n","The commission, however, wouldn't be the right place to go, according to Lauterbach. She says the commission works very slowly and it would certainly be better to address those responsible face-to-face. She has one wish for the future: \"That everyone pays closer attention. And that goes for the referees and coaches too.\"\n","Looking forward, she believes it is particularly important to get more girls and women into the sport at all levels. \n","The German Chess Federation has been working on measures to prevent sexual harassment and violence in the sport since 2021 and is looking to expand this concept further. Its website directs users to a contact person solely for this purpose. In Germany, that point of contact is provided by the \"Safe Sport Contact Point\", which is run by the government, the states and organized sports.\n","Lauterbach hopes that better education at the grassroots level can bring greater awareness of sexism in chess. It must be very clear to all that such behavior will not be tolerated, she said.\n","\"I think we have to get to the point where the deterrent is so high that no one can allow themselves to do this anymore.\"\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","\"Bonmati slams Rubiales at men's Champions League draw 31.08.2023\"\n","Spain's World Cup-winning star Aitana Bonmati won the UEFA Women's Player of the Year award and spoke out against suspended Spanish Football Federation president Luis Rubiales.\n","Bonmati, also part of Barcelona's Women's Champions League-winning team, helped Spain seal their first World Cup title in Australia and New Zealand last month. The celebrations, however, were overshadowed by Rubiales forcibly kissed midfielder Hermoso on the lips during the trophy presentation.\n","\"We're not talking about the title because things that should not have happened have taken place,\" Bonmati said at the award ceremony, whch was part of the men's Champions League group stage draw. \n","\"As a society, we should not allow abuse of power in the work environment.\n","\"I would like to tell my team-mate Jenni and all women who have been through the same thing: We're with you.

Visibly caught up in emotion, all she managed at first was a big sigh.\n","King retired from tennis in 1983 after an illustrious career that included winning 12 Grand Slam singles titles. But her most significant victory came off the court. On the opening night of the 2023 tournament, King celebrated the 50th anniversary of the US Open becoming the first sporting event to offer equal prize money to female and male competitors.\n","This year's final Grand Slam tournament offers a record purse of $65 million (€60 million) and caps off 17 consecutive years with pay equity at all four Grand Slams. King, the woman who \"made it all possible,\" in Obama's words, found herself lost for words in the center of the biggest tennis stadium in the world.\n","In her tribute, Obama recalled how King, the US Open champion in 1972, allied with her fellow women's tennis players, threatening to boycott the tournament the following year unless women got the same prize money as men. That same summer, it was announced that the women's winner's purse would increase by $15,000 (€13,800), meaning that both men's and women's champions would each receive $25,000 (€23,000).\n","In 2007, Wimbledon was the last of the Grand Slam tournaments, along with the French Open, to move to equal pay for both genders, 39 years after the open era of tennis began in 1968.\n","\"Women's tennis is the leader in women's sports,\" King said during her speech. \"But while we celebrate today, our work is far from done.\"\n","The work she is referring to was on show in the lead-up tournaments to this year's US Open. The Canadian Open offered a total prize pool of $9.4 million, of which only $2.8 million went to the women's draw. In comparison, the men pocketed $6.6 million despite players from both sexes playing the same amount of sets in the competition.\n","Since 2021, in even-numbered years, the men's tournament has been held in Montreal, while the women's competition is held in Toronto, and vice versa in odd-numbered years. Some argue that the revenue of the men's tournament brings more spectators through the gates and generates more TV money.\n","Even some stars of the game, like Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, bought into that narrative. \"The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men's tennis matches,\" said Djokovic at the 2016 Indian Wells Masters. \"I think that's one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.\"\n","Nadal made similar remarks at the 2019 Australian Open: \"If they sell more tickets than what we sell tickets, they deserve more than us.\" Both have since backtracked, voicing their support for a union of the men's and women's governing bodies.\n","A week after the Canadian Open, the discrepancy in prize money was on show again at the Cincinnati Masters, even though the women's and men's draws took place at the same venue, meaning fans paid the same amount of money to watch men's and women's matches.\n","But yet again, the men's champion Djokovic took home around $1 million (€920,000) in prize money, while his female counterpart Coco Gauff had to settle for roughly $450,000 (€420,000) — less than half. Women's tennis might be making progress, but it is still very much playing catch-up. \n","Former world No. 1  Andy Murray is one of the biggest advocates for equal pay in tennis. Confronted with the disparity in prize money before his first match in Cincinnati, Murray said the governing bodies of tennis — the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which manages the men's tour, and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which manages the women's — have to work together to find a solution.\n","\"I always felt like when we're competing at the same event on the same courts, we should be playing for the same prize money,\" said the former Wimbledon champion. \"It is difficult for it ever to become truly equal until the ATP and the WTA sort of actually combine and work together.\"\n","In a first step in that direction, the WTA announced in June that all combined 1000- and 500-level events, the sport's top competitions outside the Grand Slams, will offer equal prize money by 2027. The non-combined tournaments will do so by 2033.\n","If everything goes to plan, Billie Jean King will be 89 years old by the time prize money in professional tennis will be evenly distributed between men and women. Half a century after the tennis champion's activism won equal pay for women at the 1973 US Open, she still leads a fight for equity far from done.\n","Before leaving the stage on Tuesday, King finished her speech with a quote from American civil rights activist Coretta Scott King: \"Struggle is a never-ending process. Freedom is never really won. You earn it, and you win it in every generation.\"\n","Edited by: James Thorogood\n","'Spain football federation demands Luis Rubiales to resign over kiss 28.08.2023'\n","Spain's football federation asked Luis Rubiales to resign as president on Monday night after he kissed Jenni Hermoso on the lips at the Women's World Cup.\n","The regional presidents of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) held a second emergency meeting after Rubiales repeatedly refused to step down in recent days, sparking national and international outrage.\n","\"After recent events and the unacceptable behavior that has seriously damaged the image of Spanish football, the presidents request that Luis Rubiales resign immediately as president of the RFEF,\" the football federation said in a statement.\n","Hermoso previously said she \"felt vulnerable and a victim of an assault, an impulsive, macho act, out of place and with no type of consent on my part.\"\n","The statement from the football federation officials also urged an overhaul in the organization's management — something many Spanish players have demanded in the wake of the incident.\n","\"We will urge the relevant authorities to carry out a profound and imminent organizational restructuring in strategic positions of the federation in order to make way for a new stage in the management of Spanish football,\" it read.\n","Women football players worldwide have voiced solidarity with Hermoso over the past week.\n","The Spanish national women's team signed a joint letter with Hermoso saying they would no longer represent their country unless the current leadership of the football federation is removed.\n","Further afield, women in football and their male counterparts have formed a chorus condemning Rubiales' actions and his refusal to step down.\n","Former Germany goalkeeper and two-time Women's World Cup winner Nadine Angerer said the incident has deeply affected players.\n","\"It's absolutely disgusting what happened,\" Angerer told DW on Monday.\n","\"You just won a World Cup.

No Friday, Sunday, or (God forbid) Monday fixtures. The decision to establish a single top-tier league of 16 clubs in West Germany had been made at a national congress of the German Football Association (DFB) held in Dortmund in July 1962.\n","\"This decision makes me happy. At last, we have it,\" West Germany coach Sepp Herberger, who had been a congress delegate representing the Southwest German Football Association, said at the time according to the DFB Journal.\n","This made West Germany one of the last major European countries to get a single top-tier league. England's Football League, which became the Premier League in 1992, had already been founded long before, in 1892. Italy's Serie A kicked off its first campaign in 1898, Spain's Primera Division in 1929, and France's Ligue 1 followed in 1932. Even the \"other\" Germany was far quicker to establish a top tier league than West Germany: The Oberliga began play in 1949, before the state of East Germany had even been officially founded.\n","Many had grown tired of a rather cumbersome system that the DFB had used to determine Germany's football champion since 1903. Under that system, the champions of the regional leagues (at first eight, later 16) would face each other in a knockout tournament to determine the national champion.\n","The disadvantage to this system, though, was that it meant the country's top teams in any given era or season would only face each other once a year. Many also argued that a single top-tier national league running over an entire season was a fairer way to determine a champion, rather than a two-legged knockout tournament — in which, in theory at least, a lesser team could win the title by hitting a strong run of form at just the right time. The Bundesliga would change all of that.\n","Clubs had to apply to the DFB for admission to the Bundesliga for its inaugural season. A total of 46 of the 74 clubs in West Germany's top regional leagues (Oberliga) did so. The DFB had predetermined a system meant to distribute the teams over the entire country: Three would come from the north, five each from the west and south, two from the southwest and one from West Berlin.\n","The selection, which was made by a five-member Bundesliga commission, was based on sporting, economic and technical criteria. A major factor was a club's performance in the Oberliga over the previous 12 seasons. While several clubs were named to join this new league without dispute, several others were cause for considerable controversy. Much of the reason for this was that the commission didn't always strictly follow its own criteria in determining which clubs to invite.\n","To smooth things over with some of those who were excluded, the idea of increasing the number of teams in the inaugural season to 18 or even 20 was raised, but ultimately rejected. A total of 13 of the clubs that didn't make the final cut lodged protests with the DFB — all of which were unsuccessful. It may seem hard to imagine in 2023, but among these were a certain Bayern Munich.\n","The founding members of the Bundesliga were: Hamburg, Werder Bremen and Eintracht Braunschweig from the north; Eintracht Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Nuremberg, 1860 Munich and VfB Stuttgart from the south, Borussia Dortmund, Cologne, Meidericher SV (better known as Duisburg), Preussen Münster and Schalke from the west. Kaiserslautern and Saarbrücken were admitted from the southwest; Hertha were chosen to represent West Berlin — a decision made more for political than for footballing reasons. The honor of becoming the Bundesliga's first champions went to Cologne.\n","The next major change came in 1991: Germany's reunification led to an effort to integrate East German football into a united league system. As a result, the last East German Oberliga champions, Hansa Rostock, joined the Bundesliga for the 1991-92 season, along with second-placed Dynamo Dresden — with the league expanding to 20 teams for a single campaign. At the end of the season, four were relegated — including Hansa Rostock — and just two promoted from the second tier, bringing the Bundesliga back to 18 clubs.\n","1. Today's perennial champions Bayern Munich didn't join this exclusive club until 1965, when the Bundesliga expanded to 18 teams.\n","2. The last remaining founding member of the Bundesliga, Hamburg, were relegated for the first time in 2018 — after 55 years of uninterrupted membership.\n","3.

They can now pick their president from one of the 11 candidates.\n","While many young Zimbabweans put their faith in opposition leader Nelson Chamisa to usher in a better future, the CCC has struggled to establish its candidates in rural areas that are traditional ZANU PF strongholds. Farai Muroiwa Marapira, director of information and publicity at ZANU PF, said he is optimistic the ruling party will win the youth vote.\n","\"The youth has been a major part of the ZANU PF campaigns from participating in our primary elections,\" Marapira told DW. \"We have a lot of youth vying to represent ZANU PF and I believe a lot of youths were actually representing the party at ward and parliamentary elections,\" Marapira said, stressing that their political rallies had seen massive youth attendance. \n","Generational differences have defined the election campaign. 80-year-old President Mnangagwa is the older of the two main candidates. In addition, ZANU PF also celebrates its 60th founding anniversary in August. The party, long associated with the late President Robert Mugabe, has used the occasion to recall its origins as an anti-colonial liberation movement and denounce the opposition as Western puppets.\n","According to Farai Muroiwa Marapira, the party attracts a lot of interest from the youth.\n","\"More than 50% of attendance at the end of the rally was mostly the youth,\" Marapira noted, adding that they are quite happy and hope to continue attracting more youth because the policies of the president [Mnagangwa] that are youth and gender-centered. \"The results are there for all to see. The youths are very much a part of ZANU PF, which is a progressive party.\"\n","Also hoping to clinch the youth vote is the CCC, which promises new beginnings.

She and the union called on the RFEF to \"establish the necessary protocols, protect the rights of our female players and take exemplary measures.\"\n","The union said it rejected \"any attitude or behavior that violates the rights of female football players.\"\n","Futpro, it said, was committed to ensuring that such actions \"never go unpunished, that they are sanctioned and that the appropriate measures are taken to protect female footballers from actions that we consider unacceptable.\"\n","On Wednesday, the RFEF announced that it had launched an internal investigation into Sunday's events and would hold an \"Extraordinary General Assembly\" on Friday.\n","\"Surely I was wrong, I have to admit,\" Rubiales said in a video statement issued by the RFEF on Monday. \"It was without bad faith at a time of maximum effusiveness.\"\n","Rubiales has come under fire over the incident, including from acting prime minister, Pedro Sanchez.\n","\"What we saw is unacceptable,\" Sanchez said. \"And the apologies offered by Mr. Rubiales are not sufficient, I would call them inappropriate, so he must continue taking further steps to clarify what we all saw.\"\n","In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Rubiales had appeared to wonder what all the fuss was about.\n","\"The kiss with Jenni? There are idiots everywhere. When two people share an unimportant gesture of mutual affection with each other, you can't pay attention to the crap that's being said,\" the RFEF boss told Radio Marca.\n","This also came after he had reportedly told the players in the dressing room that he was going to send the entire team to Ibiza as a reward for winning the World Cup title.\n","\"In Ibiza we will then celebrate the wedding of Jenni and Luis Rubiales,\" he reportedly said.\n","This is not the first time Rubiales, who last year vehemently backed national team coach Jorge Vildas in the face of a revolt by more than a dozen players, has been the subject of controversy.\n","Last year, Spanish media reported that he had allegedly held a party in early 2020 to which 8-10 women were invited. The reports alleged that the party wound up being an orgy and Rubiales subsequently billed it as a work event. Both the RFEF and its boss have denied the allegations.\n","Rubiales' post-match actions have wound up overshadowing a sporting success no one would have thought possible just nine months ago. This is because by the end of September 2022, there was essentially no team left, after 15 players temporarily quit the national team in protest. The reason they gave was their \"emotional and therefore (overall) health,\" which made it impossible for them to participate in the national team's games until \"the situation\" was corrected.\n","At the time, the main reason was apparently coach Jorge Vilda. The players who revolted accused him of failing to respect their privacy, ignoring the reserve players, and in general not creating a professional environment around the national team. A public dispute ensued with the RFEF, which supported Vilda and threatened the renegade players.\n","Despite the first World Cup title, it was clear on Sunday that a rift still runs through the team. While the players on the pitch formed a red jubilant cluster, a second crowd of euphoric people jumped up and down in front of the bench, separated from the first.\n","Still, joy prevailed. Spain, which has already amassed an impressive collection of junior international titles in recent years, is now the first nation in the world after Germany to win both the men's and the women's World Cups.\n","\"It was so hard, we tried to imagine it, but you can't imagine something like that. And now we are world champions. It's incredible,\" a teary-eyed Hermoso told German public broadcaster ZDF.\n","Little did she know she was about to unwillingly become a central figure in an incident that would overshadow this sporting success for days and maybe even weeks to come.\n","This article, which was adapted from German, was updated after the apology of Luis Rubiales, as well as after the announcement about the RFEF Extraordinary General Assembly, the response by Prime Minister Sanchez and the statement of Jenni Hermoso and her union.\n","\"'Beyond Fame' — The art of the stars at Düsseldorf show 21.08.2023\"\n","For the exhibition \"Beyond Fame. The Art of the Stars\" at the NRW-Forum in Düsseldorf, curator Alain Bieber has selected artworks by 18 celebrities. On show are photos, paintings, drawings and sculptures. The mix of genres is as varied as the range of artistic personalities, which includes musicians, actors, writers, sports stars and politicans.\n","How did he come up with the idea for the show? \"We thought it was exciting to see all the people who were involved with art,\" Bieber told DW. He admits that, with celebrities, making visual art is often a marketing stunt. \"Ed Sheeran did an action painting once, and Britney Spears once did some flower paintings while wearing a bikini, he pointed out. For \"Beyond Fame,\" however, he says he chose people who take art seriously.\n","He says there are \"big surprises\" among them — works by German singer Tim Bendzko, for example, or even former tennis pro Michael Stich, that have never been shown in a museum before. \"You wouldn't think they'd paint like that.\" None of the selected artists had ever attended an art academy, he said. \"We want to leave judgment of the works to our audience,\" Bieber says. \"We're excited to see the reactions.\"\n","\"We cultivate Joseph Beuys' expanded concept of art here,\" explains Bieber, \"which asserts that everyone is an artist.\" One example, he says, is former Wimbledon champion Stich. After retiring from tennis, he took up painting as a hobby, studied art history for two semesters and set up a studio. Stich said it took him 10 years before he went public with his paintings. \"My art is a reflection of my personality and my emotions,\" as the exhibition organizers quote the former tennis pro.\n","The paths the selected personalities have taken to artistic expression are as varied as the people themselves are. And their choice of artistic medium is sometimes surprising. Some works are closely linked to their respective biographies. Some artists are at home in several creative fields at once. One of them is the German theater actress, author and visual artist Lea Drager. She draws images of popes, male and female, with which she questions patriarchal systems and hierarchical structures. Fellow German actress Meret Becker is active as a singer, actress and visual artist. Her work deals with social issues and she also campaigns for women's rights.\n","Musicians like Bryan Adams and Peter Doherty have sold millions of albums — and they've been creating visual art for many years. \"Good photographs are like time capsules that store memories,\" Adams told the Düsseldorf museum. Doherty, the scandal-ridden singer of British band The Libertines, sees art — along with poetry — as \"an expressive way to process his life.\" He works with blood and charcoal, combining drawing, painting, sculpture and collages of images and text.\n","The works by Canadian musician Claire Elise Boucher, aka Grimes, are populated by the kinds of fantasy figures — nymphs, cyborgs and manga characters — that she also portrays herself as in her music videos. According to the museum, she draws inspiration for her drawings and album covers from mythical and psychedelic images, borrowing figures and motifs from Art Nouveau and Surrealism, and has recently begun using artificial intelligence.\n","Whether as a counterbalance or a complement, people in politics also engage in artistic activities. For example, German Green Party politician Anton Hofreiter makes no secret of his enthusiasm for\n","nature. He earned a PhD in botany at the start of his political career, and he paints and draws flowers. For him, as the museum says, this is \"a way of recognizing how things really are.\"\n","\"Beyond Fame\" promises to arouse curiosity about little-known facets of prominent contemporaries. \"Some of our artists,\" promises curator Bieber, \"should soon be on view in other museums.\" For the time being, the artistic director of the NRW-Forum is banking on the \"Barbie\" effect: \"Whether you love Barbie or not — you simply have to have seen the latest movie!\"\n","The exhibition \"Beyond Fame. The Art of the Stars\" at the NRW-Forum runs until January 24, 2024.\n","This article has been translated from German.\n","'World Cup: Wiegman remains key as female coaches stall 21.08.2023'\n","Of her many qualities, it is Sarina Wiegman's constant composure that stands out. Even as her England side suffered defeat in the 2023 World Cup final, just as her Netherlands' team had four years earlier, she stayed calm, strolling across the pitch to her crushed players before heading to the Spain bench to congratulate the winners.\n","\"She's given us the confidence to believe in ourselves and a lot of calmness in situations where we've been put under pressure,\" England defender Lucy Bronze explained to DW. \n","Though she has fallen short on the global stage, Wiegman has won the last two European Championships, with England in 2022 and her native Netherlands in 2017. \n","But it's not just success that makes Wiegman an outlier. She was the only female coach to make the quarterfinals of this tournament and one of only 12 that started it. That is a figure higher than 2019 (nine) and 2015 (eight), though both of those World Cups had eight fewer teams. The ratio of female to male coaches is not changing much.\n","\"It would be nice if the balance gets better, and we need to work to make it better. UEFA doing that, FIFA doing that, federations need to do that and also give women opportunities,\" she said, in answer to a DW question after the 2023 final in Sydney. \n","Jill Ellis, who won the previous two tournaments with the USA, agrees. She told DW that such discrepancies are the result of opportunity deficit.\n","\"I think women can execute at the top level. I think what you're seeing, in terms of the numbers, is we've got to continue to create and invest in opportunities. We can't assign a head coach just because she's a female, we have to make sure that there's support around or that she's educated to be ready for that position when it arrives,\" she said.\n","The success of coaches like Wiegman and Ellis has, so far, not led to female coaches taking charge of prominent men's sides in the same way men often coach women. While Wiegman's links with the England men's job seem speculative for now, Ellis said it's only a matter of time until that changes.\n","\"I don't think it's far away at all,\" she continued. \"We've seen it in the US in other sports. We've had assistant coaches in NFL [American Football], Major League Baseball, NBA [Basketball]. I think it should be almost genderless if you're a good coach, you're a good coach. It's about the grassroots. In the US, for example, we hardly have any females on the sidelines of the youth.\n","\"I think it's because it's a tough environment. Parents are hard in there, sometimes, criticizing. People sometimes think that a great coach is someone screaming and yelling, because they're doing something. And so I don't think we see females in that area, and then therefore, they're not cutting their teeth at an early age.\"\n","While this World Cup and last year's EUROs in England have seen the profile of the game skyrocket, and participation numbers soar among girls, those changes don't appear to quite be filtering through to coaches. A FIFA survey in 2019 found more than 13 million girls and women played the sport, but only 7% of coaches worldwide were women.\n","\"It helps to see women on the stage, both on and off the pitch because what you can see, you can be,” said Wiegman in her pre-final press conference.\n","\"Of course what we hope is to get more female football coaches at the top level and the balance gets better than it is right now,\" she had said earlier in the knockout stages. \"Of course males are welcome too. There are lots of males who have done a very good job in the women's game, but if the balance is better that will also inspire other women to start coaching.\"\n","Though FIFA have not always been quick to grow the women's game, Ellis pointed to a program from world football's governing body that mandates there must be a female coach or assistant at youth World Cups. It is too early to judge the success of that. But there are still gender-based obstacles even for those who navigate the complex path to the top dugouts, like Chelsea coach Emma Hayes.\n","\"You're going to be held to the highest expectations. It's not good enough just to win, it has to look perfect in almost everything,\" Hayes, who has won dozens of trophies with the English club and was named FIFA's Best Coach in 2021, told a panel at an event in Sydney shortly before the World Cup final.\n","\"Maybe I've just come to accept that scrutiny over the years, and with age, it's got easier,\" continued. \"When I think about being a head coach, when I was in Chicago Red Stars [2008-10], these were the days when Twitter first started and I was overwhelmed with that. Early on in my career, I struggled with it. Now I just have processes in place. Clear Rules, I won't read social media for one reason, and that is that I think is important to protect your own confidence.\"\n","Wiegman's confidence is unlikely to have taken too much of a dent in Australia, and neither has her reputation. She will no doubt be an inspiration to many, but it's clear there is still plenty of work to do.\n","\"It is still necessary to do more to get more females involved,\" Wiegman concluded. \"I hope everyone has seen again that women and girls are inspired that they can coach or play.\" She is not alone in that hope.\n","Edited by: Michael Da Silva\n","\"World Cup: Spain's centurions realize long held dreams 20.08.2023\"\n","Spain's three most senior players, Alexia Putellas, Jennifer Hermoso and Irene Paredes may have worried that their chance of winning the World Cup would pass them by.\n","The trio, the only female players to have won more than 100 caps for La Roja, endured challenging build-ups to the tournament with their participation in the competition in Australia and New Zealand touch-and-go up right until the final moment.\n","Putellas' return from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury she suffered in July 2022, was understandably far from smooth, as she struggled to regain the form that won her back-to-back Ballon d'Ors.\n","Meanwhile, defender Paredes, though not one of the 15 players to write an email to the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) calling for the conditions under head coach Jorge Vilda to improve, voiced her support for the players actions on social media and relinquished her international captaincy role in the process.\n","And, with Hermoso having left Barcelona after falling out of love with football there were doubts from the player that it would be a feeling that would ever return, let alone allow her to be in the mental space to play the sport at the highest level on the global stage.\n","Despite all the hurdles the three players had to overcome, they sit on top of the world with World Cup winners medals — a thought that seemed impossible just a few months ago.\n","\"We tried for so many days to imagine what it is like to be world champions but we couldn't,\" Hermoso said after the final whistle. \"It is difficult to describe. it is a huge joy. I am so proud of this team. We showed that can fight as well and suffer.\"\n","As a woman of few words who trapses through mixed zones offering nothing more than a brief smile to journalists, Putellas far preferred to have her efforts on the pitch do her talking.\n","Although many felt the team's chances leading into the World Cup hinged on their taliswoman's return and skill, with fans believed Putellas' return to the team was far more important than the rest of the 15 players who were out in the cold.\n","\"Alexia and I have played together for so long,\" Hermoso told DW about her former Barcelona teammate. \"To be living in this moment with one another, it is so special.\"\n","The 29-year-old proved to only make a minimal impact and spending so little time on the field during the World Cup was a difficult pill to swallow for a player that is obsessively strict with her own exceptionally high standards.\n","Putellas made no effort to hide her frustrations during the tournament from the sidelines, throwing a water bottle centimeters away from the bench, after being substituted in the 46th minutes against Zambia.\n","Prior to her injury, the dynamic midfielder played like the ball was glued to her boots, but the technically gifted individual, having had to re-learn how to walk, run and control the ball, spent most of the tournament struggling to keep up with the pace of the game and unable to provide the pinpoint accuracy so accustomed to her, to release Hermoso or Paralluelo.\n","But, the leader within her saw her constantly corral and encourage her team, something all the players craved, according to Hermoso.\n","\"We know how special Alexia is, how special she is for the team and how special this win is for her,\" she explained.\n","For Hermoso, playing at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand seemed impossible just 12 months ago.\n","Despite, being Barcelona's all-time leading goalscorer, having netted 181 times in 224 appearances, she found herself searching for a way out from the team she has supported since childhood.\n","At the end of the 2021-22 season, following a tumultuous season off the pitch with the Barcelona fans directing much vitriol towards her, the forward moved to Mexican club Pachuca on a free transfer.\n","\"The road to this point was really hard,\" Hermoso told DW through tears. \"I had to go to Mexico just feel like a player again. To bring back my love and passion for football.\"\n","\n","\"So many people in Spain were talking and still talk about me, who I am, how I play. I've demonstrated to those people that even though I am 33 years old, I am still capable of being a good player.\"\n","Head coach Vilda kept his faith in Hermoso to be adaptable between leading the line for La Roja and dropping into midfield to accommodate teenager Salma Paralluelo, who was name Young Player of the Tournament.\n","\"Jenni had a lot of responsibility on her shoulders,\" Vilda said. \"I have known Jenni for more than 15 years, she came here as the best version of her, she has given everything she can at 33 years of age, and I am so proud of her.\"\n","Vilda's decision paid off as Hermoso, who is also Spain's all-time leading goalscorer with 51 goals, scored three times during the tournament and set-up Paralluelo's winning goal against 2019 finalists Holland in their tightly-fought 2-1 extra time win.\n","\"Life is composed of moments,\" Hermoso reflected. \"There was a moment where I had to leave the best team in the whole world. This moment now, it is the one I have been waiting for, for so long.\"\n","At 32, Paredes also knew to lift a trophy with Spain time was not in her favor, and she faced a difficult decision when the RFEF came out in support of Vilda as opposed to the players who had expressed concerns.\n","Despite the Barcelona captain not being one those to send an email, her inclusion in the side was unclear, having made herself unavailable for selection until April 2023.\n","For Vilda, the experienced center-back's reintroduction into the team was one that required little thought.\n","When asked about Paredes return after Spain's friendly against China in April, he told DW: \"She is a great player and has been for a long time, of course I am very happy to have her with us. We do not think about the past.\"\n","Paredes was the only outfield player to play every minute of the World Cup, and it was her calm head, decisiveness in the air and robustness against striker's that helped her marshal Spain's back line.\n","\"It is a dream,\" Paredes told DW. \"It’s been very hard but we knew it was possible. These moments are historic for Spanish football. It's difficult to put it into words but it means everything.\"\n","Edited by Michael Da Silva\n","\"Bonmati inspires Spain to their first women's World Cup 20.08.2023\"\n","Aitana Bonmati wasn’t even expected to play at this World Cup. But she now stands as a World Cup winner, Golden Ball recipient, and likely soon-to-be-crowned best player in the world.\n","The midfielder was at her crafty best as Spain defeated England 1-0 in the final.\n","\"I don’t have any words for this moment, it’s unbelievable,\" a stunned Bonmati told the BBC. \"I'm so proud because we played a great tournament. We suffered but also we enjoyed it. We deserve it.\"\n","\"Everyone knew the goal during our preparations at the beginning of the tournament. Everyone in the squad is competitive and has a strong mentality to win. We have been working for many years for this moment and we have it. We have the trophy.\"\n","In a match that was always going to shift and sway in the midfield, Bonmati led the way as Spain suffocated and nullified England for much of the 90 minutes. \n","It’s been a breakout tournament for the 25-year-old, who’s usurped Alexia Putellas as Spain’s most influential player.\n","There’s good reason why Pep Guardiola said he was \"completely in love with her for the way she plays\".\n","All eyes pre-game were on Spain’s counterparts, particularly Bonmati’s Barcelona teammates Keira Walsh and Lucy Bronze.\n","This was England’s final. Euros winners from 2022, bronze medalists from the last two World Cups in 2015 and 2019. Heavy investment in the women’s game has been paying off with the Women's Super League exploding and muscling its way ahead of other nations' leagues.\n","But Bonmati wasn’t so prepared to allow England that kind of dominance in this final.\n","The opening 20 minutes saw chances fall to both sides, with England’s Lauren Hemp stinging the post and Salma Paralluelo scuffing her lines from just a few yards out.\n","But as Bronze galloped upfield into a wall of Spanish defenders on the half-hour mark, La Roja hit with clinical precision.\n","Mariona Caldentey played a perfect ball into the onrushing left-back and captain Olga Carmona, allowing her to hit a perfect first-time effort past Mary Earps for her third goal of the tournament.\n","\n","Thereafter, Spain suffocated the the first half, shutting down Walsh’s options moving forward and forcing England into hopeful forays on the wings.\n","“We had all studied the English team and it was the game of our lives,\" Carmona said. \"We managed to neutralise very good players from England. We won this game on our merit, not because England did not play well.”\n","Bonmati grew up in a coastal town south of Barcelona and was born into a family that instilled in her a rebellious nature from birth.\n","Spanish children are given both parents’ last names and Bonmati’s family wanted to break away from norms and attempted to list her mother’s last name first.\n","They fought against the long-held rule of prioritising the father’s name, and won.\n","She told the Players' Tribune before the World Cup that she had a willingness to fight for women's rights \"in her blood\".\n","It’s what fueled her fight for her and her teammates' rights against the Spanish FA and coach Jorge Vilda in 2022, when 15 players went on strike in an attempt to instigate change.\n","She was vilified in parts of the press and missed out on precious minutes with her nation but she was passionate about the Spanish FA needing to \"invest more in us\".\n","In the end, she put aidse her grievances to return to the national setup, intent to prove herself on the international level after a stellar season for Barcelona.\n","Bonmati enhanced her reputation across the past 12 months, winning the Liga F and Champions League for Barca, before scoring three goals and two assists at the World Cup.\n","Her performances have prompted praise from the highest quarters, with Guardiola labeling her the female Andres Iniesta, and Xaxi saying “gets me off my seat, that’s the reason people are so passionate about this sport”.\n","England coach Sarina Wiegman rang the changes at halftime as she attempted to get Walsh involved, with Lauren James and Chloe Kelly introduced to the game.\n","It changed the dynamic in midfield slightly as England tried to force Spain on the backfoot.\n","\"The first half we didn’t have our best game, we just couldn’t get near them. But the second half I think changing the shape was much better,\" Millie Bright said.\n","\"You know, winning the duels, being aggressive, putting them on the backfoot. But it’s small margins in football and this shows how cruel it can be.\"\n","Despite the improvements from England tactically, Spain adapted to the changes and still continued to forge the better chances, with Earps forced into a superb right-hand save across her body to deny Caldentey in the 50th minute.\n","Spain were then gifted an opportune chance to put the game to bed in the 70th minute when VAR awarded a penalty for a handball in the box from Walsh. Jenni Hermoso’s poor effort was covered by Earps, however, forcing Spain to find another way to close down the game.\n","With Bonmati stationed firmly in midfield alongside Teresa Abelleira and Hermoso, an organized unit forced the clock down with every trick they could find, frustrating England and the majority of the white-and-red-clad crowd.\n","\"We knew their qualities but we have a very good team. That’s why we’ve been doing a lot of work and we were confident in ourselves.

It's hard enough to keep women in sport at the best of times and anything we can do to encourage women to stay in sport is a huge legacy that we can leave,\" she said.\n","As one of the nine host cities of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand, Auckland sought to address this issue before the World Cup began, aiming to create an everlasting legacy.\n","In June, Tataki Auckland Unlimited, the region’s economic and cultural agency, organized a youth symposium for 14–18-year-olds focused on educating young female and male football players on menstruation and the effects it can have on athletes' bodies.\n","Taelor Pickering-Parker was signed on to help coordinate between an advisory board for the symposium and the speakers for the event.\n","The head coach of the Papakura women's and the Maori women's teams was an avid football player herself, but began coaching at the age of just 16. \n","It gave Pickering-Parker a unique perspective on trying to play football while menstruating and trying to coach her own set of young girls.\n","\"We see that the rates of participation further down in the age groups in football suffer a steep decline,\" the 25-year-old told DW. \"It was important to ask the question: 'Does menstruation have an impact on that decrease?'\"\n","Equally, as a Maori, she was aware that menstruation is a particular barrier to Maori and Pasifika women and girls participating in education and physical activity.\n","\n","\n","\"Menstruation is not something I have ever been open about in terms of my own experience. I also lacked knowledge about it, in terms of facts and these barriers were spoken about at the symposium,\" she said.\n","\"I don't even speak about it with my own family, let alone strangers, so it was a bit awkward. It was a nerve-wracking experience, especially having males in the room too.\"\n","Although it may have been a personal challenge to speak and listen openly about such a taboo subject, Pickering-Parker praised the symposium for offering a welcoming and understanding space for the girls and boys who attended.\n","She said that as a coach of menstruating girls, the information she heard from the various speakers helped her become a better and more empathetic coach.\n","\"It's a lot easier being a female coach to understand because I can relate to this issue personally,\" said Pickering-Parker. \"I've had many male coaches and the conversation is something that is misunderstood.\n","\"Once I learned more from the symposium, it made me a lot kinder to the players and myself because now I know a little more deeply why things are happening in players' bodies and minds.\n","\"As a coach I feel I have a lot more in my toolbox now. Just learning that a lot of female injuries happen around menstruation, because of the loss of blood for example. It validates how I felt as a player and now as a coach, it helps me support my players through that time.\"\n","Jayda Scanlan is one of players coached by Pickering-Parker, for both the Papakura women's and the Maori women's team.\n","The 14-year-old agreed to be on a 10-person advisory board for the youth symposium, offering her own input on the areas the speakers would address.\n","Research company Honoco reported that young Maori and Pasifika Aucklanders are 63.6% more likely not to play a sport they are interested in because clothing or equipment makes them feel self-conscious.\n","\"Trying to have the symposium remove the stigma around periods was important to me,\" Scanlan told DW. \" It's not a gender-neutral topic, it's mainly focussed on girls and it can be uncomfortable for boys to talk about it.\n","\"We really tried to help the speakers include both a female and male point of view so the boys could feel included and also understand the various topics more than it just being about periods and specifically personal for girls.\"\n","\n","The symposium also gave the teenager the confidence within herself to accept differences she now faces as athlete as she is going through menstruation.\n","After the event, Tataki Auckland Unlimited reported that 88.3% of participants felt more confident to speak to others about periods, something Scanlan could not have imagined before.\n","\"As an athlete I would turn up to training and games with low energy and motivation due to periods,\" she admitted. \"After the symposium, I felt far more supported knowing other people also experience the symptoms I am getting while playing competitive sport.\n","\"I feel more confident in myself to talk to my coach and my teammates, even if it's just to ask if anyone has any spare products or being able to say 'I am on my cycle can you watch out for me a little.'\n","\"It is something that helped me come out of my shell a little bit more and to be able to talk to my teammates and my coach about what I'm going through at that time.\"\n","As World Cup legacy's go, this may well have been one of the most important in safeguarding and enriching future generations of the Football Ferns.\n"," Edited by: Chuck Penfold\n","'Tony Gustavsson cements his place in Matildas history 16.08.2023'\n","The many faces of Tony Gustavsson tell the story of a football match better than any match commentator. He rides the highs with pure joy and the lows hit him like a brick to the face.\n","The Swede is not just a coach for the Matildas; he's their biggest fan, a fervent motivator, a human being who allows his players to be themselves.\n","Gustavsson has a quirky streak to him, he's a people person who wants to be liked. Thoughtful, courteous and fiercely loyal to his players.\n","\"He's so passionate and he loves this team like his family. I've never seen anything like it from a coach, he genuinely feels everything that we feel,\" vice-captain Steph Catley told DW.\n","\"I can't speak highly enough of him, he's been incredible. He's led us brilliantly, led us bravely and just believed in us from the very beginning.\"\n","Selfless and humble can be added to the 50-year-old's list of traits. He's often repeated that he's simply a cog within a bigger team.\n","When DW asked him earlier in the tournament whether he was bothered that the players get all the plaudits when Australia wins, while he takes the flak when they lose, he was resolute.\n","\"I can take the hits. The role of any coach is to take the hits when the team has them,\" he said. \"Nothing is about me, it's all about the players. I will always be there to protect them, whatever they need. It's my job.\"\n","Gustavsson entered Australian football in September 2020, his first head coaching gig in international football after being an assistant under Jill Ellis when she led the United States to the 2015 and 2019 World Cup titles.\n","In his first press conference as head coach of Australia, Gustavsson said \"passion, love and joy\" fueled his football journey and he targeted World Cup glory even then, saying \"I wouldn't be here if I didn't think it was possible.\"\n","The Matildas ultimately fell short of that dream, losing 3-1 to England in the semifinal, but their performances, attitude and relatability have elevated football's standing in the country.\n","On the pitch, Gustavsson addressed a dearth of squad depth, a somewhat fractured team culture and underperformance against the world's best teams.\n","Gustavsson mapped out an ambitious plan that held risks and opened the coach and the team up to brutal scrutiny. He insisted that the Matildas had to test themselves against the world's best to create a competitive environment within the squad.\n","This resulted in some ugly results, like when inexperienced side was thrashed 7-0 by Spain in June 2022. That followed a disastrous Asian Cup campaign in January, when Australia were knocked out in the quarterfinals of a tournament they expected to win.\n","\"Everyone's gotten behind him. And over the last couple of years we've had our ups and down, but we kind of peaked at the right time [for the World Cup],\" Australia forward Mary Fowler said.\n","\"It's nice to see how far the team's come, we have a lot to be proud of.\"\n","The high-octane, attack-minded football Gustavsson promised didn't always eventuate, most recently in an underwhelming first half against England, but he did give the team a platform to foster an unwavering team spirit.\n","\"We've had coaches in the past who haven't really understood our passion and our love for this team. And that our Australian culture is a big part of what we do out on the field and they've kind of tried to change us,\" Catley said.\n","\"He came in and adopted who we were as people and players and embraced it and loved it. He bought into what we were doing and (we) then brought in his ideas and his football brain. He's been awesome.\"\n","The likes of Fowler, Kyra Cooney-Cross and Clare Hunt were blooded into the squad under Gustavsson and the trio are expected to form the spine of the team for the next decade.\n","Gustavsson has never really had it easy with the Australian public and press. He's ridden through a fair share of calls for his head, most recently after the 3-2 loss to Nigeria in the group stages.\n","Defensive fragility, poor game management, and a lack of a meaningful Plan B were the oft-repeated criticisms, and not without reason.\n","He was handed the keys to a home World Cup, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Australian football. He would have rightly been pilloried for an early exit, but he leaves the tournament having played a major role in this team's legacy.\n","He delivered on many promises – mainly increasing the Matildas' player pool, getting more talented youngsters their first caps, and making Australia competitive against the best. They beat England, France, Spain and Sweden in the seven months leading up to the World Cup.\n","Now, the onus is on the administrators, the Australian government and the corporate world to back up those on-pitch performances, and help ensure the Matildas' on-field legacy is matched by meaningful change off it.\n","\"I've said before it's bigger than 90 minutes of football. It's emotional to sit here and talk about when we've lost a semifinal. I hate to lose,\" Gustavsson said after the England loss.\n","\"But hopefully we won something else. We won the heart and passion for this game in this country. This is not the end of something, it needs to be the start of something.\n","\"We have to keep working and growing the game together. Let's invest more and be genuine contenders for medals and tournaments moving forward.\"\n","Gustavsson loves referencing inspirational quotes and sage pieces of advice from former mentors. But his personal mantra is his most repeated: \"one day better.\"\n","\"I want to get better every day, not just one day older. I sit here one day older, but hopefully one day better as well,\" he said.\n","He enters the World Cup third-place playoff having taken charge of 41 matches, with 19 wins, 6 draws and 16 losses. The last 13 of those victories came in the past 16 games.\n","His relentless quest for self-improvement has rubbed off on his players. The team epitomizes everything Australians love and respect in sporting teams: a never-say-die attitude, a willingness to do whatever it takes and, most importantly, an ability to beat the best.\n","The Matildas are the only team, and Tony Gustavsson the only coach, to defeat Sarina Wiegman's England. Despite falling to them at the World Cup, Gustavsson can be assured of a lasting legacy in Australian football. And he may get a chance for revenge at the Paris Olympics next summer.\n","'Living diversity: How Afro-Germans are reaching for the stars 16.08.2023'\n","People with African roots are active across many professions in Germany: They may be working as shopkeepers, care workers, musicians and service providers. They are also increasingly represented in the media, at universities and other areas of public life.\n","But for some years now, they have also started taking a central place in politics.\n","\"The presence of Black people is especially visible in politics. They stand for a society that is more diverse than it often is perceived,\" said Tahir Della, spokesman for Initiative of Black people in Germany (ISD).\n","In an interview, he told DW it's exciting to see people who grew up in Germany and who are part of all existing structures to also be represented this way.\n","The association, which dates back to 1985, estimates the number of people of African origin in Germany to stand at around 1.2 million. While this number may seem low at first glance, Della said it also means that they are not proportionally represented in society.\n","Joe Chialo is among those Black Germans who is making a name for himself following his election as Berlin's culture senator on April 27.\n","He knows the economic impact this particular industry has on Berlin, and is also aware of the responsibility that comes with it. \"I am fully aware that the outgoing senator for culture [Volker Lederer — Editor's note] is very popular here in the city, and that the coming years will be full of challenges,\" Chialo told the German press agency dpa.\n","Chialo was born in Bonn in 1970 to a Tanzanian diplomat family. He later attended a Catholic boarding school near Cologne with his brother.\n","However, the political career of the 52-year-old has included some unusual stops along the way. Chialo trained as an industrial cutter in a mill, studied history, politics and economics for a few semesters and then dropped out to follow his passion for music.\n","He joined the hard rock band Blue Manner Haze, which had several successes in the 1990s. Around the same time, he became a member of the Green Party.\n","Years later, he would switch sides and joined the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 2016 — but only out of support for former Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy.\n","Chialo became known nationwide when he was appointed to the \"future team\" of then-chancellor candidate Armin Laschet during the 2021 federal election. Laschet lost the election, and Chialo lost his chance for having an office in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament.\n","However, in the greater scheme of things, this was only a minor setback for Chialo, who describes himself as \"Afropean.\"\n","In fact, his fresh perspectives on many of the major contemporary issues have helped him gain a major following. From challenging European views on Africa to addressing the Catholic Church's handling of abuse cases and Germany's failure to manage its digital transformation, Chialo has attracted plenty of attention and is being watched left, right and center for his future political ambitions.\n","Della said Chialo is widely appreciated for his unique views, but stresses that whether he can cement a future as a solid force for change remains to be seen.\n","\"From my point of view, it is to the credit of the younger Black movement that Black people are now increasingly participating in the political process, contributing their positions and thus also contributing to a society that is characterized by diversity and fairness,\" Della told DW.\n","Aminata Toure is also making strides in Germany's political classes. She's the first female, Black government minister in her home state of Schleswig-Holstein, heading the Ministry for Social Affairs, Youth, Family, Senior Citizens, Integration and Equality since mid-2022.\n","Toure was born in Neumünster in 1992, where she grew up at a refugee shelter. Her parents had left their home country Mali after a military coup in 1991. Toure was not even granted German citizenship until she was 13 years old.\n","Toure went on to study political science and French literature, later becoming involved with the Green Party.\n","In 2017, she joined the Schleswig-Holstein state parliament in Kiel, becoming deputy speaker just two years later — the youngest person ever to hold this office and the first Afro-German.\n","And then she made a splash appearing on the cover of the German Vogue magainze.\n","In an interview with the fashion magazine, Toure appeared confident, highlighting the importance of fighting against racism and supporting the integration of refugees.\n","She told the fashion and lifestyle magazine that political processes need to become more transparent to reach social groups that do not care about politics.\n","Della said Toure's story highlights how people of all colors can reach success and have the best qualifications in Germany. \"You can't deny that something has changed in the last 10 to 20 years\" with regards to racist attitudes in Germany, he said.\n","Stephanie Ann Jones, known as \"Steffi,\" is one of the most successful German soccer players.\n","The 2003 world champion and three-time European champion retired from her active career in 2007, which was followed by her appointment as president of the Organizing Committee of the 2011 Women's World Cup.\n","The daughter of an African American soldier and a German mother went on to become the national coach of the German national women's soccer team — a position she held from 2016 to 2018.\n","And then she decided to say goodbye to the beautiful game, launching a new career as an entrepreneur in the software industry.\n","However, despite her remarkable achievements, Jones, too, is familiar with casual racism. She has had to deal with insults being hurled at her on the soccer pitch.\n","Della said, however, that things have become easier for people of color in sports as well, where they can make a difference and leave a lasting legacy that outshines their successes on the field.\n","Edited by: Sertan Sanderson\n","\"England spoil Kerr's and Australia's World Cup party 16.08.2023\"\n","The noise, the hype, the billboards, the speculation. Then, finally, the goal. The eruption. The surge of collective belief pulled from the pit of doubt. It wasn't to last.\n","Sam Kerr may have finally marked her arrival to the World Cup party in the style to which we've become accustomed, but even her brilliant long-range equalizer wasn't enough to delay Australia's exit for long.\n","As Lauren Hemp slipped past Ellie Carpenter to restore England's lead eight minutes later, Kerr puffed out her cheeks on the halfway line. It was not to be the last time her face would betray her frustration, with two late missed chances punished by Alessia Russo, after stunning work from Hemp. As the final whistle blew, the Australian captain bent double, hands on her knees, the weight of a nation on her shoulders.\n","\"That's usually my bread and butter,\" said Kerr of her missed opportunities. \"But unfortunately this World Cup hasn't gone as planned.\"\n","Given her hard-running display and starting berth, it was almost possible to forget about Kerr's calf. The injury that dominated the opening weeks of the tournament had faded in significance as the Matildas blasted, cruised and then edged their way further than they'd ever been before.\n","But, as in the last round against Colombia and their army of fans, England were in no mood to lay out the drinks and nibbles for a Stadium Australia party.\n","\"We're such an experienced squad,\" Hemp said, in response to a question from DW in the postmatch press conference. \"We faced part of that in the Colombia game, the fans were absolutely wild, they were unbelievable. I felt like the Australian fans were unbelievable again and it was a fantastic atmosphere. But even after Sam's goal, I feel like there was no fear in the squad. We weren't nervous, we just played our football. I think that showed the relentlessness inside the squad.\"\n","And, for all the noise early on, Australia seemed in no real hurry to provide the entertainment. The hosts sat off England, allowing the European champions to dictate the tempo until their captain briefly set a new tone.\n","By that time, Ella Toone ensured England had something more concrete. Hemp and Russo kept a throw-in alive long enough for Toone to run onto the loose ball and slice a sweet strike home.\n","Given the impact of Lauren James earlier in the tournament, Toone would almost certainly have been starting this one on the bench, but for James' sending off against Nigeria. It isn't the first time Toone has made an impact as a replacement, scoring the opener in England's Euros final win from the bench with an equally memorable strike a year ago.\n","With three successive World Cup semifinals and that Euros win, as well as England's investment in women's football ― from grassroots through the Women's Super League (WSL) to the expensive appointment of coach Sarina Wiegman and a well-resourced senior team ― the foundations are well established. With Wiegman as their architect, England's house is looking well in order.\n","Australia will hope that this tournament, a success in every way, will enable them to follow suit.\n","\"It's been amazing to see the reaction from the Australian public to what we've been doing,\" said Australia's Steph Catley. \"[Particularly] from where we've come from. You couldn't find a more appreciative group than us. It has been so special.\"\n","Though in a better spot than many at this tournament, a crowded sporting landscape in Australia has often seen football pushed aside, with a domestic league that struggles to retain its best players ― a major challenge yet to be solved.\n","Important as it is, questions of legacy are for another day. For now, the players in green and gold are left with a mixture of pride and frustration that their opponents were, until recently, all too familiar with.\n","The optimists in the Sydney stands, Melbourne fan parks and Perth pubs will believe this team can improve. Others may struggle to see a better chance than a home tournament. Kerr, at the end, appeared to be in the latter camp.\n","Edited by: Chuck Penfold\n","'United planned Greenwood return amid fan protests: reports 16.08.2023'\n","Manchester United began the 2023-24 Premier League season with a narrow 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford on Monday night, a match preceded by supporter protests against the potential return of striker Mason Greenwood.\n","Greenwood, 21, was arrested in January 2022 after an audio recording emerged on social media of an alleged sexual assault, accompanied by images and video footage of apparent injuries.\n","Following a police investigation, Greenwood was charged with attempted rape, controlling and coercive behavior and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, all of which the player denied.\n","In February 2023, the United Kingdom's Crown Prosecution Service dropped its case against him, saying that \"a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.\"\n","Greenwood has been suspended by Manchester United since his arrest. The club has also been conducting its own internal investigation before deciding whether or not to allow him to return to the first team, for whom he scored 35 goals across two-and-a-half seasons from 2019 to 2022.\n","A decision was expected to have been made by the start of the new season and, as The Athletic reported on Wednesday, August 16, it was expected to be that Greenwood would be allowed to return.\n","According to The Athletic, the intended date for the announcement was to be Friday, August 4, and it was intended to involve a video in which United's chief executive, Richard Arnold, would explain the decision to both club employees and the general public.\n","Arnold was reportedly expected to explain that Greenwood would be brought back into the first-team set-up but would not be doing any work with the Manchester United Foundation, the club's charitable arm, in the short-to-medium term.\n","However, the announcement did not go ahead. \n","Later on August 16, United made their first public statement on the issue, saying: \"The fact-finding phase of our investigation is now complete and we are in the final stages of making a decision on Mason's future. Contrary to media speculation, a decision has not yet been made and is currently the subject of intensive internal deliberation.\"\n","The club also acknowledged \"strong opinions\" provoked by what it called \"partial evidence in the public domain,\" adding that its own investigation had \"drawn on extensive evidence and context not in the public domain.\"\n","Finally, the club confirmed reports that its final decision would be \"communicated and explained to internal and external stakeholders\" - believed, according to widespread British media reports, to include major sponsors, the club's fan advisory board and its women's team, three of whom are currently representing England at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\n","Before and after England's quarterfinal win over Colombia, goalkeeper Mary Earps and midfielders Ella Toone and Katie Zelem were targeted on social media by apparent Manchester United fans petitioning them to support Greenwood's return.\n","On the ground in Manchester, however, other female supporters organized a demonstration ahead of the Wolves game behind a banner reading: \"Female fans demand no Greenwood return. End violence against women.\"\n","\"The message to Manchester United is: 'Think about what you're doing. History is going to judge you,'\" One of the organizers, who are all long-time United season ticket holders, told The News Movement outside Old Trafford.\n","\"We feel that there is a lot at stake here. Footballers are huge role models for children and young people. Does Mason Greenwood deserve to earn a living? Yes. Should that be at Manchester United, where he's a role model to millions of children and young people across the world? Absolutely not.\"\n","While other male fans agreed, one countered: \"The police have had a go, and the charges have been dropped, so, for me, nothing has happened, and there's no case to answer.\"\n","To that argument, another protester, giving her name just as Em, told \"The News Agents\" podcast:\n","\"A process is a process, and a contract is a contract, but, for me, this is not a contract issue; it's an ethics issue, a morality issue. If we want to move the sport forward in terms of proper respect for diversity and inclusion, then you have to take a more grown-up stance and back the supporters.\"\n","Another protest organizer told The Athletic: \"This is a tipping point for the club. Are they going to side with commercialism and trophies and money? Or are they going to take the side of match-going fans, and the club being a social and community institution that we can be proud of and proud to have as part of our identity?\"\n","The discrepancy between opinions voiced, often anonymously, online and those held by people on the ground is an increasingly common one in modern professional football.\n","Just in the last month in Germany, a section of Borussia Dortmund supporters raised objections to the signing of midfielder Felix Nmecha, who had drawn criticism for a series of homophobic social media posts.\n","But the issue is particularly acute in England's Premier League, where clubs make billions of dollars from global broadcast rights and sponsorship deals but still rely on local supporters to actually physically attend their matches in the cities where they are based.\n","A similar split can also be observed on issues such as kickoff times being scheduled particularly early or late to suit television audiences, the prospect of a European or even global Super League and, most acutely in the case of Manchester United in recent months, the issue of a potential sale of the club to Qatar.\n","\"My primary sense is that, in Manchester, among those supporters who go to the games, people don't want [Greenwood] to play, but how that plays out on social media and across the rest of the world, I'm not too sure,\" summarized Em, who also called for more vocal support from United's male supporters.\n","\"There is support, and there is vocal support,\" she said. \"As so often, it's women leading this, but I'd like to see more men be vocal about it. Some of them are, and we're grateful for that. But there's a lot of silent acceptance.\"\n","With United's England internationals set to remain in Australia for the Women's World Cup final on August 20, a decision from the club on Greenwood in consultation with the women's team has been put back.\n","Indeed, with the England players then set to go on holiday, it's possible that an announcement won't be made until the September international break.\n","Either way, it is understood that, while the women's team and other stakeholders will be asked for their opinions, those opinions won't ultimately reflect the final decision, which will be made by chief executive Richard Arnold based on the outcome of the club's internal investigation.\n","Asked during United's preseason tour of the United States earlier this month, head coach Erik Ten Hag said: \"Of course, I have said my ideas and opinions, but it's a club decision. We all have to accept that.\"\n","Potentially still short of a striker, despite the signing of Danish forward Rasmus Hojlund, it is understood that Ten Hag is open to the idea of Greenwood bolstering his squad's attacking options.\n","Further complicating matters is United's current financial situation. With the club having recently been fined €300,000 ($327,850) by the European governing body UEFA for what the club described as \"a minor break-even deficit\" during the four-year period 2019-2022, the return of a prolific young striker who is already contracted to the club has an obvious sporting and financial attraction.\n","The question being asked by those United supporters protesting outside Old Trafford is, therefore: what is more important?\n","Edited by Chuck Penfold.\n","('EU lawmakers want anti-war declaration for Russian and Belarusian athletes '\n"," '15.08.2023')\n","A group of members of the European Parliament have called on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to introduce an anti-war declaration for Russians and Belarusians wanting to compete at next year's Paris Olympics.\n","The IOC says it is yet to decide whether athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus can participate in the Games, although it has recommended that international sports federations allow some to take part in Olympic qualifying events as neutrals, citing their human rights.\n","In a letter to the IOC's president, Thomas Bach, the MEPs demanded more clarity on the conditions for participation and suggested that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be required to sign a \"statutory\" document declaring their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n","\"By signing, athletes would publicly condemn any aggression against any of the UN (United Nations) member states,\" the group of 39 MEPs wrote in the letter dated July 21.\n","Last month, with a year to go before the Paris Olympics, the IOC omitted Russia and Belarus from its official list of Games invitees, but the possibility remains for Russians and Belarusians to compete in the French capital as \"Individual Neutral Athletes.\"\n","\"Though we appreciate not sending official invitations to Russian and Belarusian athletes, it is simply not enough,\" the MEPs added. \"The IOC's efforts must go further and not settle on using neutral flags.\"\n","In May, sports ministers from more than 30 countries raised concerns that the IOC's current recommendations — which exclude teams from Russia and Belarus, as well as anyone who has actively supported the war or who is contracted to the military — were open to exploitation.\n","\"While some aspects (...) have been addressed by the IOC, there are substantial issues remaining, not least around military connections of athletes, state funding, the definition of what constitutes teams, and on enforcement mechanisms,\" the ministers said in a joint statement.\n","Signing an anti-war declaration would appear to be a no-go for Russia, with the country's sports minister threatening an all-out boycott of the Olympics if that were to be a requirement for participation.\n","\"There is a red line: No one will sign any declarations to condemn the special military operation and so on,\" Oleg Matytsin, the sports minister, told Russia's parliament last month, in comments reported by the Russian state news agency TASS. \"Our athletes will not participate on such terms.\"\n","However, the group of MEPs, made up of politicians from all the main parliamentary parties and from 15 countries including Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, warned that the absence of a declaration could result in athletes being \"used by both regimes for propaganda purposes.\"\n","\"It is usual for dictators and authoritarian regimes to weaponise sport as an instrument of expanding their influence,\" the MEPs wrote. \"For Russia and the Putin regime, sport is primarily a political tool; this has been clearly demonstrated by the fact that Russia has a state-sponsored doping programme.\n","\"Under the current conditions, the participation of Russia and Belarus, including the teams and support personnel representing these countries, is inadmissible while the aggression against Ukraine is ongoing.\"\n","DW asked the IOC for comment on the letter but was referred to a Q&A document on the Olympics website, where the IOC labeled political interference in sport as \"deplorable\" and complained that its \"autonomy is being undermined by some governments.\"\n","However, in their letter, the MEPs say that the organization should follow its own Olympic Charter, which aims to use sport to promote a peaceful society.\n","\"The IOC thus has to take a clear stance in order not to distance itself from its own values and ignore tens of thousands of Ukrainian casualties, many of them innocent civilians, children but also athletes,\" the MEPs wrote.\n","\"A decision of such importance cannot be simply devaluated by repeating the principle of 'political neutrality.'\"\n","Edited by Chuck Penfold.\n","\"Women's World Cup sees attendance and TV-rating records tumble 13.08.2023\"\n","The noise was immense.

A few hours later, Australia followed suit as almost 75,000 fans cheered on the Matildas' 1-0 win over Ireland.\n","Now, as the semifinals approach, ticket sales are expected to hit 1.98 million for the entire tournament, which would equate to an average of 31,000 fans attending each of the 64 matches.\n","That has easily eclipsed the previous record of 1.35 million at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, which averaged out to 26,000 fans per game. \n","It should be noted, though, that in 2015 only 24 teams were involved, as opposed to the current 32. This means just 52 matches were played instead of the 64 at this year's tournament. Another factor that may have contributed to the higher numbers is the fact that this time there have been two host nations instead of one – even if New Zealand failed to get to the knockout stage.\n","Considering that the initial target was 1.3 million and later increased to 1.5 million, the attendance represents a massive success for the host nations. Football has simply exploded in Australia and New Zealand over the past month, and global interest has been equally impressive.\n","Australia may be a fanatical sporting nation, but soccer has always struggled for widespread attention against rugby and Australian rules football, which dominate the media headlines and TV ratings.\n","Yet the Matildas' round-of-16 match against Denmark reached 6.54 million people on the free-to-air Seven Network, more than the country's biggest showpieces in 2022: the National Rugby League and Australian Football League grand finales.\n","\"It's been immense.

The stadium didn't reach 50% capacity across its six games, though it did sell out for New Zealand's draw with Switzerland.\n","Considering the nation's obsession with rugby, however, and its population of just five million, the numbers outperformed expectations, with the record for the largest crowd for a football match in the country being broken three times in Auckland.\n","\"The noise was deafening,\" New Zealand co-captain Ria Percival told DW after the Football Ferns' opening day win over Norway. \"I've never heard anything like that, and I cannot believe so many people came to watch us play. It was amazing.\"\n","Defender Claudia Bunge said: \"I never dreamed of playing in front of a sold-out crowd at Eden Park.

Their four matches averaged 3.80m, up from their first four matches of the 2019 World Cup.\n","The United Kingdom recorded a peak audience of 5.2 million on BBC One for the knockout victory over Nigeria, which kicked off at 8:30 a.m. in Britain.

About 4.58 million viewers watched China's opener against Denmark on CCTV5.\n","Considering the boom that women's football received following the 2022 European Championship in England, there were fears that the host countries' unsociable kickoff hours for many time zones could hamper interest.\n","Those concerns have been well and truly quashed, showing that the appetite for the women's game is following that for men's football.\n","FIFA has said the tournament is on target to reach an overall audience of two billion people worldwide, significantly up from the 1.19 billion the organization reported from the 2019 World Cup.\n","The quality on show has also been at a higher standard, even after the tournament increased from 24 to 32 teams, to allow budding nations a chance to test themselves against the very best.\n","Big scorelines have been few and far between, and many underdogs, such as Morocco, South Africa and Jamaica, produced upsets in the group stages. Not only is the level improving, but the gap between the top and the bottom is decreasing.\n","With four matches to go, the show isn't over yet.\n","While New Zealand have been knocked out, Australia still hold hopes to lift the trophy. If the Matildas were to make the final, TV viewership could even rival the eight million that tuned into Cathy Freeman's victory in the 400m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.\n","\"It's nice to see where the game's going here, how many girls and boys want to play football,\" Foord said. \"It's just nice to know the game's moving in the right direction.\"\n","Edited by Matt Ford\n","'The most anticipated new films of 2024 29.12.2023'\n","The dual Hollywood strikes — writers' and actors' — threw a wrench into the 2023 movie schedule.

The landmark structure has since become the symbol of the French capital and one of the world's most-visited attractions.\n","It is only through a quirk of history, however, that the striking tower bears the name of Gustave Eiffel, or that it is even standing today.\n","The engineer was initially not enthusiastic about the structure designed by Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nougier, colleagues in his construction company, Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel.\n","That's why Eiffel involved his chief architect, Stephen Sauvestre, in the planning. The number of floors were reduced from six to three, while Sauvestre changed the position of the foundations and added the striking round arch under the first platform.\n","Eiffel, Koechlin and Nougier jointly applied for a patent on the design principle. Eventually Eiffel bought the copyrights from his employees.\n","The structure was subsequently named Eiffel Tower. But it could also have been called the Koechlin & Nougier Tower or the Sauvestre Tower. Who remembers them today?\n","Critics initially disparaged the design as a \"tragic lamppost,\" a \"disgusting ink stain,\" or the \"disgrace of Paris.\"\n","An open letter against the project was published in the magazine Les Temps on February 14, 1887.\n","\"We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate lovers of the still intact beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength and indignation in the name of misunderstood French taste, in the name of art and threatened French history, against the construction of the useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower,\" the letter stated.\n","Among the signatories were writers such as Guy de Maupassant, Leconte de Lisle, Charles Gounod and Alexandre Dumas. \n","The latter criticized the \"dizzying ridiculousness\" of the tower, which would dominate the city like a \"gigantic black factory chimney\" and overwhelm the architecture with its \"barbaric mass.\"\n","But the idea of the tower caught on and Eiffel was able to quickly realize the construction, which consisted of 18,000 individual parts.\n","He even took on a large part of the financing by securing the lucrative usage rights for 20 years. People's curiosity about the monumental half-timbered tower was huge from the start.\n","Eiffel, who was born in Dijon on December 15, 1832, perhaps inherited his business savy from his mother, Catherine Moneuse.\n","The daughter of a timber merchant, she had invested in the booming hard coal business and the family's wealth grew massively within a short period of time.\n","In 1856, Gustave entered the service of Charles Nepveu, a civil engineering contractor and by his mid-20s the young Eiffel was already the construction manager of one the largest construction sites in France, the Bordeaux railway bridge.\n","Things got off to a good start for Eiffel professionally, but he was still single in his 30s, and wrote to his mother that he needed \"a neat housewife who won't pester me too much.\" His mother found a match for him: 17-year-old Marie Gaudelet, whom he soon married.\n","The young Eiffel's constructions were in demand everywhere. He soon built churches in the Philippines and Peru, the Western Railway Station in Budapest, bridges in Vietnam and the iron framework of the Statue of Liberty in New York.\n","The plan was to demolish the Eiffel Tower once Gustave Eiffel's 20-year permit to use the land had expired.\n","However, the engineer wanted to have his masterpiece preserved for posterity. Early on, he started searching for a scientific purpose for the tower that would justify its existence.\n","He set up a meteorological and an astronomical observation station, while scientific experiments were carried out there also.\n","In 1898, the first wireless telegraph connection was established between the Eiffel Tower and the Pantheon.\n","By 1910, no one would have even considered demolishing the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel's rights were renewed for decades. \n","During the First World War, the French army used the Eiffel Tower as a strategic observation post.\n","And it remained standing despite being threatened during World War II: The Nazis decided not to blow up the tower in 1944 when their defeat became apparent.\n","After the Second World War, all sorts of athletes — mountaineers, motocross riders, mountain bikers, bungee jumpers, parachutists and even tightrope acrobats — found a way to integrate the striking tower into their stunts.\n","The Eiffel Tower is still a top tourist attraction in Paris today, but is now considered a \"rusty old lady.\"\n","The 324-meter-high (1,063-feet) and 7,300-ton iron tower was not actually intended to last forever since initial plans were to have it dismantled.\n","According to research from 2022 by French magazine Marianne, corrosion is causing major damage to the tower that urgently needs an overhaul.\n","\"We saw Notre Dame burning, will we see the Eiffel Tower collapse?” asked the article's author.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'China: Top electric automaker BYD to build plant in Hungary 22.12.2023'\n","China's top electric carmaker BYD announced on Friday it plans to build a car factory in Hungary, in a bid to expand into Europe despite an investigation into Chinese subsidies in the tech field.\n","BYD Europe announced plans to build a factory in the southern Hungarian city of Szeged.

But the British director convinced her that his film, based on the 2014 novel of the same name by British writer Martin Amis, would be different.\n","In the shadow of mass extermination, the entire film plays out like a family drama as the Höss family picnic by the river, play in the garden or chat with their friends.\n","Meanwhile, the award-winning German psychological drama, \"The Teachers' Lounge,\" made the short list with a more contemporary theme.\n","Described by The Hollywood Reporter as \"a pulse-pounding exploration of the ways we draw lines between enemies and friends, and the courage it takes to blur them,\" the film portrays a teacher's vain attempt to uncover a crime.\n","Director Ilker Catak's provocative drama shows how individuals are ultimately worn down by entrenched power.  \n","Tokyo-set \"Perfect Days,\" a film by veteran German director Wim Wenders, is also short-listed for best international feature and is Japan's Oscar entry.\n","Legendary actor Koji Yakusho won best actor in Cannes for his lead role as an ageing, Zen-like toilet cleaner in the film that showcases Tokyo's architect-designed lavatories.\n","Other international feature films on the 15-film short list for nominations include Tran Anh Hung's \"The Taste of Things\" (France), Lila Aviles' \"Totem\" (Mexico), Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki's \"Fallen Leaves\" and \"The Monk and the Gun\" from Bhutan.\n","\"'The Monk and the Gun' is a story about the change and transition that Bhutan went through in the 2000s, when we became the last country in the world to allow television, to allow the internet and to allow democracy to come in,\" filmmaker Pawo Choyning Dorji told DW of the film.\n","Variety magazine has ranked \"The Monk and the Gun\" as a \"top-tier possibility\" for the award.\n","Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer\" and Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" were prominently represented among the finalists in many categories, including score and sound.\n","The opulent \"Oppenheimer\" was a notable omission, however, among the 10 finalists in the visual effects category.\n","Both \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" did make the cut for makeup and hairstyling, while \"Barbie\" missed out.\n","Big names also featured in the live action category, with both Pedro Almodovar's western \"Strange Way of Life,\" starring Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal; and Wes Anderson's \"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,\" with Benedict Cumberbatch and Ben Kingsley, in the running.\n","The final list of nominations in all categories for the 96th Oscars will be announced on January 23.

On the way he listens to a cassette from his extensive collection of ‘60s and ‘70s rock classics (The Rolling Stones, Otis Redding, the Kinks and, of course, given the film's title, Lou Reed).\n","Hirayama's job is cleaning the public restrooms in Toyko's Shibuya district. His work — all the scrubbing, sponging, brushing and mopping — isn't glamorous but it is an important service, and Hirayama, played with effortless cool dignity by Japanese screen legend Yakusho Koji, goes about it with the same consciousness and careful attention to detail we see in every moment of his day. \n","The toilets themselves are, frankly, beautiful. One is bright white dome, like a landed spaceship. Another resembles a labyrinth of wooden planks. One has brightly colored, but transparent walls. When an American woman, clearly confused, asks how it works, Hirayama, without a word, slips inside and locks the door. The glass turns opaque.\n","Every one of the buildings featured in \"Perfect Days\" is an actual public toilet, part of an architecture project to renovate the facilities in Tokyo's Shibuya ward.\n","When the Nippon Foundation started the Tokyo Toilet Project in 2018, it was, says project coordinator Yamada Akiko, to counter the image of public toilets as \"dark, dirty, smelly and scary.\"\n","Some of the country's leading architects, including Ban Shigeru, winner of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize, and Kengo Kuma, the award-winning designer of the V&A Dundee museum, reinvented the idea of the public toilet with advanced designs for 17 WCs in the Shibuya area, created not just to be works of art but also structured to be accessible for everyone \"regardless of gender, age or disability.\"\n","More than just a public service, the project is a \"way of moving toward the realization of a society that embraces diversity,\" says the Nippon Foundation. \n","The Shibuya district contacted Wim Wenders, asking if he would make a documentary about the project. Wenders has a long and intimate connection to Japan. The German director cites \"Tokyo-Story\" (1953) from Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu as one of main reasons he became a filmmaker.  In 1985, he made a documentary on Ozu, \"Tokyo-Ga.\" Four years later, he made \"Notebook on Cities and Clothes,\" another Japanese-set documentary, about fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto. \n","But for Wenders, the Tokyo Toilet Project was about more than architecture, it was about something deep in Japanese culture. Instead of a documentary, he decided to make a feature drama with the Tokyo Toilet Project at its core. \n","\"On the one hand [there is] the strong feeling of 'service' and 'the common good' in Japan,\" Wenders said in a recent interview. \"On the other hand, the sheer architectural beauty of these public sanitary places. I was amazed at how much 'toilets' can be part of everyday culture, not just an almost embarrassing necessity.\"\n","There is undoubtably something unique about Japan's toilet culture. Public toilets in Tokyo are ubiquitous. The city has 53 public WCs per 100,000 residents.\n","Berlin, which recently doubled the number of available facilities, still has just 11.5 per 100,000 people.\n","Even the most humble public facilities in Japanese gas stations or fast food restaurants are a wonder of fastidious hygiene. The country is the world leader in toilet high-tech, with washlets typically including heated seats, built-in bidets with jets to wash and dry users bottoms, automated flushing and, often, a choice of music to mask toilet noises.\n","Toto, the country's leading toilet manufacturer (and a partner in the Tokyo Toilet Project) has its own museum dedicated to the history of the ceramic flush toilet. \n","For Wenders, Tokyo's toilets express something unique, and deeply admirable, about Japanese culture. A drama about a Berlin toilet cleaner, one imagines, would be a grim affair. But \"Perfect Days\" is actually closer to a Zen meditation on the pleasures of the simple life.\n","Hirayama is like a modern-day monk; his daily rituals a form of spiritual meditation. Every day, he eats his lunch on the same bench in a temple garden, and takes a photograph (with an analog camera) of the same patch of light through the treetops.\n","In an interview, Yakusho Kaji has said the film, co-written by Wenders and Japanese screenwriter Takuma Takasaki, is based on the Japanese concept of komorebi, a word which describes the play of light and shadow through the leaves of a tree, where every shimmering moment is precious and unique.\n","The depiction is idealized, but it isn't naive. There is conflict. When Hirayama’s carefully-balanced routine is disrupted —at one point he is forced to do a double shift to cover for another cleaner who quit without warning — he loses his cool in a rare angry outburst.\n","A short scene with his estranged sister hints at a childhood trauma Hirayama is trying to escape.\n","\"Perfect Days\" is not some panglossian new age pap but a tender contemplation of the rewards and regrets of a flawed life (is there any other kind?), lived in a conscious and considered manner. \n","It has certainly won over audiences. \"Perfect Days\" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Yakusho Koji took the award for best actor. Japan picked the film as its official entry for the 2024 Oscars in the best international feature category, a rare honor for a non-Japanese director. \n","The Tokyo Toilet Project has been similarly successful.\n","According to a survey by the Nippon Foundation, satisfaction among users of the 17 redesigned facilities has shot up from 44% to nearly 90%, and the number of people with negative views of public toilets shrank from 30% to just 3%.\n","\"People who previously didn't give much thought to public toilets have started to take an interest in the facilities,\" said Nippon Foundation Executive Director Sasakawa Junpei. Thanks in part to \"Perfect Days,\" the toilets are becoming tourist attractions in their own right.\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'From Bach to Brazil with mandolinist Avi Avital 19.12.2023'\n","\n","If you've ever listened to bluegrass, you're probably familiar with the mandolin. That it can also be found today on the classical concert stage is largely thanks to one contemporary artist: Avi Avital. He joined forces with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider at the 2023 Beethoven Festival in Bonn to present old, new and genre-blending works that spanned different cultures and time periods. The program included everything from Bach fugues to Balkan rhythms to Afro-Brazilian gods and goddesses.\n","Mandolinist Avi Avital was born in Israel in 1978. He began playing the mandolin at age eight and went on to study the instrument in Jerusalem and Padua, Italy. In 2010, he became the first mandolin player ever to be nominated for a Grammy.\n","A member of the lute family, the mandolin was originally a common folk music instrument. It made its way around the world over centuries, but it's thanks to Avital's expressive and virtuosic playing that it recently exploded onto the classical and new music scenes.\n","\"The mandolin was seen as an amateur instrument throughout music history, so the great composers ... never bothered to write for the mandolin. We don't have a mandolin piece by Bach, Brahms, Schubert,\" Avital explains. \"I don't feel this is justified, and so I think one of my life missions is to change the course of the repertoire of the mandolin and to insert it into the canonic repertoire of classical music by going to living composers and pursue them to write for me, to write for the mandolin.\"\n","Avital has commissioned more than 100 works over the past years as a way to cement the mandolin in the classical new music scene.\n","One such brand-new piece of music is the prelude for solo mandolin, by the contemporary Italian composer Giovanni Sollima; he composed the work specifically for Avital. Sollima drew on Italian dances like the tarantella and the pizzica, which is from Apulia, in southern Italy. The region has a festival dedicated exclusively to this style of music.\n","Similarly to Avital, the members of the string quartet Brooklyn Rider (Johnny Gandelsman and Colin Jacobsen, violin; Nicholas Cords, viola; Michael Nicolas, cello) perform both old and new music, which they believe are complementary.\n","\"One of the ideals you're going for in music is to have a feeling when approaching old music that it is fresh, and you are seeing always new things. But then when you got a brand-new piece of music, you have to very quickly behave as if it's your oldest friend in the world, and that it feels not foreign but familiar,\" says violist Nicolas Cords.\n","Brooklyn Rider violinist Colin Jacobsen is also a composer, and one of his compositions, \"Time and Again,\" which he wrote in 2022 for string quartet and mandolin, was featured on the Beethoven Festival program.\n","\"My piece was very much conceived with Avi in mind,\" he says, explaining that it includes Balkan rhythms yet still maintains classical elements: \"For those who are keeping score in form, it is also in a very classical sonata-ish form; those of you who are listening for that, you'll hear it.\"\n","The other pieces on the program also spanned cultures and geography. One was \"Obrigado,\" which means \"thank you\" in Portuguese. It was written by the contemporary Brazilian-American composer, singer and pianist Clarice Assad and pays tribute to the various Afro-Brazilian gods by using musical traditions of the Afro-Brazilian religion called Umbanda.\n","Another work, \"Entr'acte,\" is by the contemporary American Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Caroline Shaw, who took inspiration from a Haydn quartet. \n","But the old was not forgotten among the new, with arrangements of Bach fugues for string quartet and mandolin, and even a Bach chaconne arranged for mandolin making appearances in the program.\n","No matter what repertoire he's playing, mandolinist Avital feels deeply connected to the instrument in a physical way. \"This instrument has soul,\" he says. \"It just reacts to me where it's part of my body.\"\n","We hope you enjoyed the works in today's show, which was hosted by Cristina Burack.

The \"smoking man\" is a wooden figurine that serves as an incense burner. It's just one of the many traditional Christmas decorations from the Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, a Saxony border region renowned for folk art in the form of wooden angels, Christmas pyramids and candle arches known as Schwibbogen.\n","But the fact that no one ever came up with a proper English translation for the little smoking man suggests it isn't yet one of the region's famous international exports —  unlike its direct cousin, another wooden figure traditionally made in the Ore Mountains: the nutcracker.\n","A German-French-Russian-American story\n","The nutcracker gained international recognition thanks to its various cultural representations, and the fact that authors from different countries borrowed from the original tale. International copyright agreements didn't exist when an initial version of the little toy figure's story was written by German Romantic author E. T. A. Hoffmann in 1816, titled \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.\"\n","It was adapted by French writer Alexandre Dumas in 1844. The plot of \"Histoire d'un casse-noisette\" (simply called the \"The Nutcracker\" in English) was nearly identical — but the French version wasn't nearly as dark as the German one.\n","In any case, Dumas' adaptation served as the basis for the 1892 Russian ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, with music composed by Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky.\n","The first complete performance of the ballet only reached England in 1934, and it was staged for the first time in the US during the Christmas of 1944 by the San Francisco Ballet company.\n","It was such a hit there that it has been staged during the holiday season ever since. With hundreds of productions every year, the ballet is now a firmly entrenched Christmas ritual for thousands of families in the US — and throughout the world.  \n","Friedrich Wilhelm Füchtner, the Ore Mountain carver who came up with the first \"mass produced\" model of a nutcracker in 1870, obviously didn't know that the character would one day become the star of an international ballet classic. He actually had another version of the story in mind when he created his figurine, one written by the creator of \"Der Struwwelpeter\" (Shaggy Peter), Heinrich Hoffmann, in 1851.\n","The German figurine found its way into homes around the world much later. One woodcarving company from the Ore Mountains, Steinbach, had to relocate to Hanover after World War II, where many American soldiers were stationed nearby. The soldiers started to bring back nutcracker dolls for their families as typical souvenirs from Germany.\n","The collectible figures continue to attract visitors to the eastern German region renowned for its wooden folk art.\n","Along with the area's different workshops, the Nussknackermuseum in Neuhausen, the \"first nutcracker museum in Europe,\" is another recommended stop. It not only retains the record for the largest nutcracker collection in the world; it also hosts different events throughout the year beyond its exhibition, such as an annual nutcracker collectors' convention.\n","Asked why the nutcracker became so closely associated with Christmas, the museum's owner, Uwe Löschner, provided a down-to-earth explanation that's typical of the pragmatism of the people of the region: \"During Christmas time, poor people used their nuts when they would bake their traditional Stollen (fruit bread) and cookies; and nutcrackers were used to crack those nuts,\" he told DW.\n","The nutcracker is more than a just a good-looking tool. Its symbolism continues to be shared across generations and countries thanks to the fairy tale that contributed to its international fame — a universal story of hope and of triumph of good over evil. \n","This article was first published in 2021.\n","\"'The Monk and the Gun': Why Bhutan's Oscar entry 'unties a knot' 19.12.2023\"\n","Filmmaker Pawo Choyning Dorji's family originally comes from the eastern part of Bhutan where, if a child asks a parent to tell them a story, they ask them to \"untie a knot.\"\n","Dorji's latest film, \"The Monk and the Gun,\" is his way of untying the knot that was his homeland's social, political and cultural transition in the mid-2000s. \n","\"I was growing up during this period and 'The Monk and the Gun' is a story about the change and transition that Bhutan went through in the 2000s, when we became the last country in the world to allow television, to allow the internet and to allow democracy to come in,\" Dorji said. \n","But as a Bhutanese living in India, where his father was a diplomat, and returning to his homeland for school holidays, he had a unique perspective on the changes that were engulfing the Himalayan kingdom.  \n","\"In Bhutan, we have a saying that you cannot see your eyelashes because they are so close to you. For me, that was the situation. A lot of Bhutanese at that time could not see the changes and the impact of that transition because it was so close to them,\" Dorji told DW in Thimphu, Bhutan's capital. \n","\"But for me, as a Bhutanese living abroad, I could see how our society and culture was changing — and I always thought this would make an amazing story to share with the world. It's a story of where we as Bhutanese came from and where we are going.\" \n","The film is set in 2006, as Bhutan shifts to a democracy and the government organizes mock elections to teach the people how to vote. In a connected plotline, an American collector of antique weapons arrives in search of a legendary rifle that falls into the hands of a monk. \n","The story is political satire and gentle comedy with elements of suspense combined with touching scenes, Dorji says, with audiences in different parts of the world responding to different elements. \n","When the film received its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado on September 1, audiences laughed at the political satire, while viewers in South Korea responded to the \"story of family,\" Dorji added. \n","But the response in his homeland was the most powerful, he admits. \n","\"When the film went to Bhutan, it was really beautiful because I had a cinema where all the audience was crying and becoming emotional because they connected in a very personal, intimate way in the loss of innocence because they lived through that period of change and transition.\" \n","\"The Monk and the Gun\" is Bhutan's submission to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the 96th Academy Awards for the Best International Feature Film. A total of 89 titles are on the initial list, with the academy to announce the 15-film shortlist on December 21. The official nominations will be unveiled on January 23, 2024, ahead of the March 10 Oscars ceremony.\n","Variety magazine has ranked \"The Monk and the Gun\" as a \"top-tier possibility\" for the award. \n","Bhutan has only previously submitted two films for consideration for an Oscar, \"The Cup,\" in 1999, by Dorji's film-making mentor and spiritual teacher Khyentse Norbu, and Dorji's own directorial debut, \"Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom,\" in 2021.  \n","\"Lunana\" — the heartwarming tale of a teacher posted to the most remote village in Bhutan — made history when it became the first Bhutanese film to be nominated for an Oscar. \n","\"Lunana is a story about finding home, where you belong,\" he said. \"It is a very diverse film, it is of a culture that many people do not know of, it is set in a country that many people do not know of, it is in a language that many people have never heard of. When I submitted it to the Oscars, they did not even recognize 'Dzongkha,' my national language. The country of Bhutan was not even on the Oscars list.\" \n","After winning stunning reviews and multiple film awards around the world, Dorji received the Heart Son of the Thunder Dragon, Bhutan's highest civilian award, from King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.\n","Critical and commercial success enabled Dorji to focus on his second film and the challenges of a poor, developing country in the 21st century. \n","\"Yes, the movie focuses on the transition to democracy in Bhutan, but it is more about modernization,\" Dorji said of \"The Monk and the Gun.\" \"What interests me is how Bhutanese culture reacts to that change.\" \n","\"The gun in the movie represents the arrival of modernization. A gun is something Western and modern and yes, if you use it in the right way, it can be very beneficial. But it is also very dangerous.\"\n","Dorji instructed his actors to be bemused by the weapon; to hold it upside down, look down the barrel, because he wanted to portray their innocence in the face of change. And the gun is counterpointed by a large wooden phallus, a traditional symbol in Bhutan that the film used to portray tradition, culture and innocence. \n","Dorji insists he has not thought about winning the Oscar in Los Angeles next year but is focused on \"sharing Bhutan's culture with the rest of the world.\" \n","\"We are a culture that is based on the Buddha's teaching of love, compassion, wisdom and kindness and I want to use films to share that with the rest of the world,\" he said. \"But I also want to make films based on these values to keep our traditions relevant and alive for local Bhutanese.\"  \n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'Remembering Lars Vogt at the 2023 Heimbach Festival 18.12.2023'\n","\n","Imagine you had to program a concert — but not just any concert. Your very last concert ever. What music would you choose? Pianist Lars Vogt chose Brahms' Piano Quartet in C minor.\n","In summer 2022, Vogt was dying of cancer, and he and his loved ones knew he didn't have long. In September that year, his death unleashed profound grief at the Heimbach \"Spannungen\" (\"tensions\") music festival, which he had founded some 25 years prior. He had also served as its artistic director, performed as a pianist there and conducted many of the ensembles.\n","Vogt was in his late 20s when he launched the festival, and he wanted to create a musical experience that contrasted with the typical philharmonic hall operation. He envisioned a place of retreat, a festival with a family feel, where the highest quality chamber music is performed in innovative, thoughtful and intimate ways.\n","And he achieved this: The festival kicked off in 1998 and soon became a meeting place for Germany's best chamber musicians. Its fame grew quickly and soon extended beyond Germany to Europe and the rest of the world.\n","Today, the Heimbach music festival is known as the \"Bayreuth of chamber music,\" with audience members traveling from as far as the US and Japan to attend concerts.\n","Heimbach is a quiet town in the hilly Eifel region of western Germany, right on the border to Belgium and the festival is set in the town's striking hydroelectric plant from the early 20th century. Built in the \"Jugendstil,\" or art nouveau style, it's replete with graceful curves and elegant geometry. It also has incredible acoustics.\n","Vogt's passing left a profound hole in the festival, but also renewed a sense of purpose among the artists, the loyal audience, the festival helpers and the sponsors: to carry on the unique spirit of the festival that Vogt had poured his soul into.\n","\"There is something very, very special about this festival,\" says Tanja Tetzlaff, a cellist who has long been involved in the festival and helped organize the 2023 edition, which was dedicated to Vogt. \"It's not about showing off or appearances, about fame or standing in the spotlight; it's really just about the music and the friendships and the relationship with the audience. I'm quite optimistic about what comes next because Heimbach is already such an institution in Germany and internationally. That won't change quickly.\"\n","Vogt was proud of his festival, especially of how it combined well-known pieces and historic works with musical rarities and contemporary compositions. Vogt shared his opinion in an interview some three years ago:\n","\"I think we've built a certain 'brand,' to use a modern term. But it can be described in a nicer way — we've built trust. When people attend a concert here, they'll see two, maybe three composers on the program that they haven't heard of. And maybe also new music. But they trust the artists and know that whatever they do will make sense, and they're open to it. That's the way it should be: We should be broadening people's perspectives. And I hope it stays this way.\"\n","The 2023 festival did just that, with its innovative program of contemporary music, classics reimagined and even brand-new works.\n","Ten contemporary composers wrote new compositions for the festival edition, including the Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth. Her piece was entitled \"In Memoriam Lars\" and featured Tanja Tetzlaff on violin.\n","Another unique work was the final piece on the festival's opening concert: a chamber music arrangement of Beethoven's sixth symphony, the \"Pastoral\" symphony. There was no conductor, no large orchestra — just a string sextet led by first violinist Antje Weithaas. It was grand orchestral repertoire reduced to minimal instrumentation, to its essentials, one could even say, and it certainly let the audience hear the work in a new way.\n","We hope you enjoyed the works in today's show, which was hosted by Cristina Burack.

Further down, the plinth is decorated with reliefs featuring World War II battle scenes.\n","One of several such monuments across Bulgaria, and one of over 4,000 across Europe, it has dominated the Sofia skyline ever since as a symbol not just of victory over fascism, but also of what would become 45 years of hardline communist rule as Bulgaria was absorbed into the Soviet bloc.\n","When the USSR collapsed in 1989, the local council voted to have it removed but successive governments have shied away from actually going through with it, often under pressure from the Russian embassy and pro-Russian elements of society.\n","Nowadays, Bulgaria is a member both of the European Union and NATO and a recent poll showed that the majority of Sofia residents would like to see the monument removed and put in a museum, or even demolished.\n","The park surrounding the monument has become a gathering place for young people and alternative sub-cultures, and it has often been painted by artists in different colors – most recently in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine.\n","\"This propaganda tool from bygone days must disappear from the city center,\" 19-year-old economics student Daniel Roussev told AFP news agency.\n","The newly-elected mayor of Sofia, Vassil Terziev, made dismantling the monument one of his key election promises.\n","Officially, authorities have said they are taking the monument down because it has become structurally unsafe, but local councilor Marta Georgieva said jubilantly: \"It is a long-awaited event.\"\n","\n","Nevertheless, one third of Sofians are opposed to its removal and the socialists and other pro-Moscow groups in parliament would like to organize a referendum on its fate.\n","On Tuesday, Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) leader Kornelia Ninova commented: \"Every monument is a piece of history, and we erase a piece of history every time we remove a monument.\" \n","A heavy police presence was dispatched to the area around the monument to prevent possible clashes.\n","\"This monument has a rightful place as it illustrates our history and the art of the time,\" Vessela Naidenova, a 38-year-old researcher, told AFP. She came to protest against the dismantling.\n","Russia has strongly criticized the dismantling.\n","\"We consider the destruction of the monument to our common past as another hostile step by official Sofia, which aggravates the already deadlocked situation in bilateral relations. Bulgaria once again chooses the wrong side of history,\" Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said.\n","According to Bulgarian media, she added: \"The barbaric actions of the Bulgarian side have no justification and forgiveness.\"\n","Originally slated to take at least a month to dismantle, authorities hope that the work could be finished by Christmas, after which the figures — arm, machine gun and all — are expected to be restored and taken to the Sofia's Museum of Socialist Art.\n","mf/wd (dpa, AP, Reuters)\n","'German star Sandra Hüller shines, from Europe to Los Angeles 11.12.2023'\n","German actress Sandra Hüller was the undisputed star of this year's European Film Awards (EFAs).\n","Europe's answer to the Oscars, the EFAs were held in Berlin on December 9. \n","Hüller had received an unprecedented dual nomination in the best actress category for her leading roles in Justine Triet's \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" and Jonathan Glazer's \"The Zone of Interest.\" \n","She not only won the best actress award for her performance in \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" which was also proclaimed best film at the EFAs, but a day later, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association picked Jonathan Glazer's  Auschwitz-set drama as best film of the year, and one of the association's top acting awards also went to Hüller.\n","Both movies were big winners at the Cannes Film Festival this year, where \"Anatomy of a Fall\" took the Palme d'Or, and \"The Zone of Interest\" won the Grand Prix, the runner-up to the Palme d'Or prize.\n","And both are major Academy Awards contenders as the official submissions from France and the UK for the best international feature Oscar. On Monday, they were both nominated for the Golden Globe for the best non-English-language film. Hüller was also among the nominees for best female actor in the drama category, for her performance in \"Anatomy of a Fall.\" She also nabbed a nomination for the Critics' Choice Movie Awards.\n","Sandra Hüller is well-known among arthouse aficionados, not least for her barnstorming performance in Maren Ade's Oscar-nominated \"Toni Erdmann\" (2016). But with \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"The Zone of Interest,\" 2023 could be the year the 45-year-old actress goes mainstream. \n","Hüller was born on April 30, 1978 and grew up in the small town of Friedrichroda in rural Thuringia, in what was then East Germany.\n","An inspiring teacher and a school theater course brought her to Berlin where, shortly after the Berlin Wall fell, she applied and was accepted to Berlin's renowned Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts. She was just 17. \n","Her ascent to the top of Germany's theater world was quick. In 2003, the year she graduated from Ernst Busch, Hüller was voted best young actress in a poll of German critics for Theater Heute magazine. \n","She's stayed true to her theater roots even as she moved into film, regularly returning to the stage in between movie roles.\n","And she has remained a critical favorite, winning Theater Heute's actress of the year in 2010, 2013, 2019 and most recently in 2020 for an acclaimed gender-flipped performance of Hamlet for Dutch director Johan Simons. \n","In Hüller's movie debut — in Hans-Christian Schmid's \"Requiem\" (2006) — she plays a young woman from a devout Catholic family who take her epileptic seizures and rebellious free-thinking as a sign of demonic possession. They order a brutal, ultimately fatal, exorcism.\n","Hüller's performance, wrenching and visceral, won her the Silver Bear for best actress at the 2006 Berlin Film Festival. \n","But it was her performance a decade later, in Maren Ade's improbably-funny German cringe comedy, \"Toni Erdmann,\" that would prove to be Hüller's international breakout.\n","She plays an ambitious and uptight corporate consultant whose career plans are disrupted by the unwanted interventions of her loving, prankster father, played by the late Peter Simonischek.\n","Hüller's performance — which includes a raw, heartfelt, but also hilarious rendition of the Whitney Houston song \"Greatest Love of All\" — leaves it all on the screen. \n","The London Critics Circle, the Toronto Film Critics Association and America's National Society of Film Critics, thought it was the best female performance of the year.\n","The European Film Academy agreed, giving Hüller the 2016 award for best actress. \n","\"Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"The Zone of Interest,\" two radically different films, show Hüller's tremendous range as an actress.\n","\"Anatomy\" is a twisty French legal drama. It is an intellectual thriller about Sandra, a successful German novelist (Hüller), living in an isolated chalet in the French Alps, who may or may not have killed her French husband, played by Samuel Theis.\n","Director Justine Triet, who says she wrote the film specifically with Hüller in mind, refused to tell anyone, neither her actors nor the audience, whether Sandra is guilty or innocent.\n","Hüller's performance, acting in English and French, is ambiguous till the end. Nearly every scene, whether fighting with her husband, comforting their young son or pleading her case in courtroom can be read both ways. \n","In Jonathan Glazer's \"The Zone of Interest,\" there's little ambiguity and virtually no sign of emotion in Hüller's turn as Hedwig Höss, the real-life wife of Rudolf Höss, the longest-serving commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Höss, played in the film by Christian Friedel, was hanged for war crimes in 1947.\n","Glazer says Hüller was \"very apprehensive\" about portraying a Nazi on screen, something that she had until then refused to do.\n","But the British director convinced her his film would be different. It certainly is.\n","\"The Zone of Interest\" looks and feels unlike any Holocaust drama before it. The film never directly shows the atrocities of Auschwitz. There's not a single scene of violence. Instead, the entire movie plays out like a perverse family drama as we watch Rüdiger and Hedwig Höss picnic by the river, play with their children in the garden or chat with their friends.\n","Just out of sight, but within earshot — there are echoes of gunfire, barking dogs and howls of pain — the murder continues. \n","Glazer rebuilt the Höss family home in Auschwitz, just meters from the the former concentration camp that is now a memorial site, and installed surveillance-like cameras to capture the actors as they did their scenes — an approach he's called \"Big Brother in a Nazi house.\" By staging his film as a reality-TV show, Glazer breaks the easy cinema conventions and clichés of the Holocaust movie. Instead of framing Hedwig and Rudolf Höss as monsters, he shows them as ordinary, even boring, making their actions both relatable and all the more horrifying. As Hedwig, Hüller is cold, almost emotionally inert. Her eyes are dark and dead, opening into a void. \n","Taken together, \"An Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"The Zone of Interest\" show an actress at the peak of her powers.\n","Update: This article, first published ahead of the European Film Awards, was updated on December 11.\n","Edited by: Brenda Haas\n"," \n","'Japan: Unpacking the nuances of the traditional bow 11.12.2023'\n","To the Japanese, the bow is something they do every day. Children bow to their teacher and say \"ohayou gozaimasu,\" or \"good morning,\" at the start of every school day. It would be unthinkable for a business meeting to commence without formal bows.\n","Shop staff and train conductors, hotel employees, janitors and deliverymen all bow to their customers. Even passing a colleague in a corridor will inevitably elicit eye contact and a deep nod.\n","It's a greeting, and it's polite. But a bow to a Japanese person imparts much more information, with each variety having a nuance that communicates a slightly different meaning.\n","\"Bowing is a key part of greetings in Japan,\" said Kiyomoto Ogasawara, the heir to the 32nd headmastership of the Ogasawara-ryu school of \"reiho,\" or etiquette.\n","\"Bowing signifies trust and peace by showing vulnerability, as we avert our eyes and expose the head,\" explained Ogasawara, whose family has served as instructors to generations of shoguns since the school was established more than 830 years ago.\n","Alongside \"reiho,\" Ogasawara-ryu masters teach the disciplines of archery and mounted archery, an important military skill as well as a religious ritual at Shinto shrines since ancient times.\n","\n","And while etiquette and archery may not appear to be compatible skills, Ogasawara said incorporating proper etiquette into a person's daily life is required to attain the strong legs and perfect posture needed to have both hands free to fire a bow from a galloping horse.\n","And that's why, historically, warriors and the elite in society were taught that posture and etiquette are of such importance.\n","It's widely believed that bowing became the accepted greeting as far back as the Asuka period, between 593 A.D. and 710 A.D. Buddhism was arriving in Japan from mainland Asia and there were shifts in the nascent nation's artistic, social and political mores.\n","In the Buddhist faith, bowing was — and remains — an important gesture of respect and piety, and it was soon adopted to indicate similar reverence for the elite in Japan's strictly hierarchical society.\n","And while the samurai no longer rule Japan, the bow has endured as the mark of respect. And failing to perform an adequate bow can still be perceived as a slight, particularly among older, more traditional Japanese.\n","Today, the bow is the time-honored greeting in Japan, but it's also used to communicate farewell, the start or end of a class, meeting or ceremony and to express gratitude. The bow is also used as an apology, to accompany a request or show sympathy or appreciation. It is deployed when a person is worshipping or at the outset of formal ceremony, and is a critical element of martial arts.\n","There are three main types of bow in the Japanese business world, but each starts from the same position: straight back, legs straight and firmly planted to avoid slouching. The bow should then be performed in time with one's breathing.\n","Bending forward from the waist should take one inhalation of breath. That position is then sustained for the time it takes to exhale and then the person performing the bow inhales again as he or she returns to an upright position.\n","The \"eshaku\" bow is a relatively casual greeting, exchanged between people of the same status or when formalities are not as important, and only requires leaning forward to an angle of 15 degrees for a few seconds.\n","Japan's national sport can now be enjoyed along with a meal. The Yokozuna Tonkatsu Dosukoi Tanaka restaurant opened its doors in Tokyo in 2022, as a place for former sumo wrestlers to demonstrate the traditional art. The concept has been met with great enthusiasm from diners.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","The \"keirei\" bow is the most common variant in the Japanese business world, and requires the person to lean at an angle of 30 degrees and look at the ground about 1 meter (about 3 feet) in front of their toes.\n","A \"keirei\" bow is used to greet clients, join a meeting or during interactions with superiors.\n","The \"saikeirei\" indicates the greatest respect to the recipient and requires a bow from the waist of as much as 70 degrees and sustained for several seconds to emphasize respect and sincerity. The \"saikeirei\" is deployed to greet a very important person, such as a member of the imperial family, to express deep regret or ask for a significant favor.\n","Men performing these bows are expected to keep their arms rigid alongside their legs, while women often place one hand atop the other in front of the abdomen.\n","Bows performed in the seated position are known as \"zarei\" and usually take place on traditional tatami mat floors during traditional occasions, such as the tea ceremony or martial arts tournaments.\n","All seated bows start from the \"seiza\" seated posture, with the legs tucked directly below and with the toes pointing straight behind. The person sits on their calves with the elbows pointed slightly out and with the palms of the hands on the top of the thighs.\n","This position can be uncomfortable for non-Japanese, especially if it has to be sustained for a long time, but Japanese will appreciate good posture.\n","The \"saikeirei\" bow starts at the \"seiza\" position and requires the person to lean forward until their chest is on their lap. Simultaneously, the hands slide forward along the thighs until they are on the tatami floor in front of the knees.\n","The final position will see the person's face around 5 centimeters (2 inches) from the floor, and the palms of the hands making a triangle on the floor.\n","The \"futsurei\" is a less formal variety of the same bow and only requires the person to dip their body until their head is around 30 centimeters from the floor. The \"senrei\" is even more relaxed and only requires the person to bow about 30 degrees from the waist and have the tips of their fingers on the tatami.\n","Another, far more rare bow, is the \"dogeza,\" which requires the person to get on their hands and knees and place their face on the ground — and was in the past used when a person was begging for their life after somehow offending a powerful superior.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Matthew Strecher, a professor of Japanese literature at Sophia University in Tokyo, was given lessons in etiquette when he first arrived in Japan in the 1980s. Emphasis was placed on a proper bow and \"not just ducking my head briefly,\" he said.\n","\"Some latitude is given to foreign people when they try to bow and I think Japanese are even quite amused as they watch us try to get it right, but I do think they appreciate the effort,\" he said. \"In the same way, they do not appreciate it when we flout expectations and make no effort at what is quite a special moment.\"\n","After more than three decades in Japan, Strecher said he knows when a less formal nod to a colleague in passing is adequate and occasions when a greater expression of gratitude or respect is required.\n","\"If I am saying goodbye, then it is important to bow properly because failing to do that would not be appreciated, and in a business setting we are expected to do the right thing because it is about ensuring the harmony of the workplace,\" he added.\n","Kiyomoto Ogasawara said younger generations of Japanese do not grasp the exact meaning of Japan's most important form of unspoken communication.\n","\"Actually, the subtle meanings of different bows are less known nowadays, even in Japan,\" he admitted. \"While they were traditionally learned in the home, I believe that anyone can grasp these nuances, with some studying,\" he told DW.\n","\"Bowing reflects our cultural identity, so it is vital for understanding our roots and sharing them with others,\" he added.\n","\"It is part of our culture, influenced by many factors, such as our history and environment. Recognizing and using different forms of bowing is very valuable.\"\n","Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru\n","'A Rubens painting keeps the courts busy 10.12.2023'\n","\"Tarquinius and Lucretia\" is the subject of long German-Russian disputes. The painting by Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) disappeared from Germany after World War II. Around 20 years ago, it was discovered in Russia — in the possession of art dealer Vladimir Logvinenko.\n","The story didn't end there. Logvinenko tried to have his ownership rights recognized in Germany — unsuccessfully. This attempt at clarification could well have been motivated by a desire to sell the painting, which is estimated to be worth tens of millions of euros. As long as it is listed in all loss registers, however, such a request is impossible.\n","The judiciary has been dealing with the conundrum for over 20 years.\n","The Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg (Stiftung Preussische Schlösser und Gärten, SPSG) and the Russian citizen Vladimir Logvinenko are still fighting over the painting.\n","The German side claims that the painting was taken to the Soviet Union in the course of looting. According to the SPSG, \"the painting 'Tarquinius and Lucretia' by Peter Paul Rubens, painted around 1610 or 1611, was part of the collection in the Picture Gallery in Potsdam's Sanssouci Park before it was removed due to the war. Like the other paintings in the gallery, it was moved to the Rheinsberg Palace in 1942 to protect it from war damage.\"\n","According to Russian accounts, the painting hung in the bedroom of a house in which a Soviet officer was residing in 1945. After the officer was transferred, he is said to have taken all the contents of the house, including the Rubens.\n","Finally, the dealer Logvinenko acquired the painting in 1999 and had it restored. The Potsdam public prosecutor's office investigated, but discontinued proceedings in 2006 because initial suspicion of a criminal offense had not been confirmed. The case concerned gang theft.\n","The Rubens painting has been a thorny issue in terms of German-Russian relations. Even the heads of state got involved. Hannes Hartung, a Munich-based lawyer specializing in international art law, wrote in his dissertation on \"Art theft in war and persecution\" that \"after the intervention of the two heads of state, Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder, in September 2003, and the confiscation at the request of the Federal Republic of Germany, it had long looked as if a positive precedent could be established through the restitution of an important exhibit.\" It seemed like the painting could be returned to Germany.\n","However, the Russian Federation's willingness to cooperate subsequently waned because \"the current owner insisted that he had acquired the painting in good faith and the Federal Republic of Germany was also unable to provide complete proof of ownership status and the exact circumstances of a war-related relocation,\" according to Hartung's explanation.\n","Nevertheless, Logvinenko is not the owner, according to the court ruling,\n","In 2021, Logvinenko then appealed to the Potsdam Regional Court to have his ownership rights to the painting recognized. In November 2023, the court ruled: \"The plaintiff is not the owner of the painting.\"\n","When asked by DW, the Potsdam court explained that the legal dispute was subject to Russian law, as the painting was indisputably located in Russia at the time of Logvinenko's acquisition. The fact that the court was nevertheless able to reach its verdict is due to a legal opinion that was obtained. According to this, the court can now take the view \"that the plaintiff is not the owner of the painting under the relevant Russian law because he did not acquire ownership either through a legal transaction or through acquisition in good faith, and did not inherit it.\"\n","\n","The current court decision from Potsdam does not mean that the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg is the owner, nor does it mean that the entrepreneur from Russia must return the painting. The foundation told DW: \"A return was not the subject of the previous proceedings. Further steps are currently being examined.\"\n","According to the SPSG, the Rubens painting had been \"considered lost since the end of the war. It is one of the most serious wartime losses of our foundation and was long-wanted by Interpol.\"\n","The foundation has no information about where the painting is currently being kept. \"It was last in the possession of a Russian citizen (Editor's note: this refers to Vladimir Logvinenko), who wanted to go to court to establish that he was the owner. The SPSG has opposed this.\"\n","Apparently, the Rubens painting is still in the possession of Vladimir Logvinenko. The Berlin-based law firm Unger, which represents Logvinenko, did not respond to an inquiry as to the purpose of the legal clarification regarding the recognition of ownership and why it took place in Germany.\n","Hannes Hartung, an expert in art law, explains: \"'Tarquinius and Lucretia' is still listed in all lost property registers. There is the state database 'Lost Art.' There are also private loss databases. A painting like this is completely unsaleable for the Russian owner as long as it is being sought as looted art, as it is now.\" The ownership status is also highly questionable because it is looted art.\n","The lawyer from Munich assumes that the Russian investor has been advised to file a lawsuit. \"Many people hope that they can plead acquisitive prescription, i.e. that the painting was seized in good faith and they therefore became the owner,\" says Hartung.\n","The currently rejected complaint by the Russian citizen can really only mean one thing: The plaintiff wants to sell the Rubens abroad. \"He needs a kind of 'clean bill of health,' but he won't get one\" from the SPSG, explains expert Hannes Hartung, who once represented the art collector Cornelius Gurlitt under civil law.\n","The Gurlitt case goes back to a large art find that raised the question of whether Nazi-looted art was among the inherited artworks.\n","Logvinenko has to bear the costs of the Potsdam proceedings as the plaintiff. He can still appeal. Hartung believes that the art dealer may have speculated. \"He thought that he would be able to sell the painting on for a large profit at some point. That's not possible with looted art.\"\n","Twenty years ago, it was still hoped that an agreement could be reached and that \"Tarquinius and Lucretia\" would be returned to Germany. And now? \"The German-Russian looted art debate is frozen. We had a very open relationship around 2006, 2007. Since the war in Ukraine, the door has been closed and there are no talks between Germany and the Russian Federation,\" summarizes Hartung.\n","The ambiguity over its ownership remains, and the stalemate may well go on for another 20 years.\n","This article was translated from German.\n","\"'Maestro' pays tribute to Leonard Bernstein 06.12.2023\"\n","Leonard Bernstein was always good for a surprise. \n","When he conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall at the end of 1989, he had the choir sing the word \"Freiheit\" (freedom) instead of \"Freude\" (joy) in the final chorus. He once spontaneously took his student, the Japanese conductor Kent Nagano, to an art exhibition instead of holding a conducting lesson.\n","For the charismatic and outgoing Bernstein, life was a dance — quite literally so, especially when he was conducting.\n","Now, Leonard Bernstein's exceptional personality shines through in Bradley Cooper's new film, \"Maestro.\" \n","Along with Bernstein's musical successes, Cooper primarily focuses on the maestro's personal life, addressing how his relationship with his wife, Costa Rica-born Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre (played by Carey Mulligan) was strained by his homosexuality.\n","Just like in his critically-acclaimed directorial debut \"A Star is Born,\" Cooper stars in the lead role, embodying the protagonist in different phases of his life. \n","In September, \"Maestro\" had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival. The film is now released in cinemas and will also be coming out on Netflix on December 20. \n","While the biopic has already garnered positive reviews, it also caused a stir ahead of its release.\n","The trailer, showing that Bradley Cooper wore a prosthetic nose to depict the Jewish conductor, stoked accusations of antisemitism.\n","Historically, antisemitic caricatures have depicted Jewish people as having exaggerated hooked noses, a stereotype that has been used to justify the marginalization of Jews.\n","Some critics also questioned why a non-Jewish actor should be cast in the role of a Jew, comparing it to Blackfacing, the formerly widespread and racist practice of non-Black performers using make-up to caricature Black people. \n","However, Bernstein's children didn't feel the nose was a problem. His 71-year-old daughter, Jamie Bernstein, described the controversy as ridiculous and said that her father actually did have a \"nice big nose.\"\n","Leonard Bernstein was born on August 25, 1918 to Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the United States. \n","In addition to music, he also studied philosophy, aesthetics and linguistics at Harvard University. \n","Bernstein made his first public performance as a pianist in 1934. Three years later, he met his mentor and close friend, the composer Aaron Copland. \n","His conducting career began in 1940 when, at the age of 22, he attended the inaugural festival at the Tanglewood Music Center, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home. \n","The film also portrays how Bernstein had his breakthrough as a conductor in 1943 when he stepped in at the last minute to conduct the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, in replacement of Bruno Walter, who had fallen ill. The critics were full of praise. Bernstein later became the orchestra's music director. \n","As a composer, Leonard Bernstein was influenced by jazz and African-American rhythms of the 1940s. He was also interested in Jewish music and sounds from his ancestors' Ukrainian homeland. He was a great musical composer.\n","His name will forever be associated with his best-known stage work, \"West Side Story,\" from 1957. A first film adaptation, by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise, came out in 1961; Steven Spielberg also directed his film version of the story in 2021. \n","Bernstein was not only a conductor and composer, but also a humanist and teacher. In the 1970s, he explained basic concepts of classical music on television in the \"Young People's Concerts\" series and introduced composers in a humorous way.\n","Many of the world's great conductors, such as Herbert Blomstedt, Kent Nagano and Seiji Ozawa started out as Bernstein's assistants. \n","The film \"Maestro\" is primarily set during the 25 years of Leonard Bernstein's marriage with his wife Felicia, who had found out that Bernstein was homosexual shortly after their wedding in 1951.\n","To the outside world, the couple initially had an exemplary marriage with three children, but both had extramarital affairs. \n","In 1976, Bernstein left his wife. But when he learned a year later that she had lung cancer, he stayed by her side until her death in 1978.\n","\"Maestro\" shows how Bernstein was conflicted by the different aspects of his life; he is portrayed as a man who remained a constant seeker, and who charmed audiences with his wit and musical expression.\n","Bernstein's children – Jamie, Nina and Alexander – were \"overwhelmed\" by Cooper's approach to their parents' story: \"He chose to involve us all through the process. We were part of his bringing this work of art to life,\" Jamie Bernstein told the press at the Venice Film Festival. \"It was touching to us, his desire to tell this story as authentically as he could.\"\n","The music scenes in particular were particularly important to Bradley Cooper. After all, his passion has always been music, he told the press during the shoot. \n","When Leonard Bernstein died in 1990, he was buried with a baton and a score of Gustav Mahler's Fifth Symphony, a work he conducted masterfully.\n","Conducting Mahler's Second Symphony, Bradley Cooper reproduces Bernstein's style in an ecstatic sequence lasting around six minutes. To achieve the scene, the actor-director took conducting lessons for six years. He conducted the orchestra in real time for the film.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","\n","\"Will Ramzan Kadyrov's teenage son follow in his footsteps? 03.12.2023\"\n","In the past six weeks, Adam Kadyrov has received more awards and honors than most people receive in their entire lifetime.

Police arrested Shuravel in his hometown of Volgograd and handed him over to Chechen officials.\n","Ramzan Kadyrov — Adam Kadyrov's father — took power in Chechnya in 2007. He is considered one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies.\n","His father Akhmat Kadyrov was appointed head of the then breakaway republic by Vladimir Putin in 2000 after he supported the Russian army in both of the  Chechen warsof the 1990s.\n","Nikolay Petrov, who heads the Russian Center for Political Geographical Research and is currently a visiting scholar at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), says the publication of the Zhuravel video may not be a coincidence. He says it was released on September 25, just one day before Ramzan Kadyrov was received by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n","\"It looks like Kadyrov is setting up a successor and introducing him to Putin,\" Petrov told DW.

And while Ramzan Kadyrov's other children will also receive awards, these are unlikely to have any political significance.\n","It is highly unusual for Ramzan Kadyrov's son to have received so many awards and honors from the republics neighboring Chechnya, Shvedov said. \"This isn't the work of the Kremlin but the product of Ramzan Kadyrov's diplomacy; it is a pretty important signal that his influence has extended beyond Chechnya's borders.\"\n","Ibragim Yangulbayev — son of former Chechen supreme court judge Sajdi Yangulbayev — says Adam Kadyrov first came to public attention when he took part in a mixed martial arts tournament in Grozny aged nine.

The company, he adds, is most likely controlled by the Kadyrov family.\n","\"Even in Chechnya, it's hard to imagine a businessman hanging a photo of someone else's child on their company's wall,\" Yangulbayev told DW. He believes these are signs Adam is being groomed as a future successor.\n","Even so, political analyst Nikolay Petrov doubts these efforts will have an impact. \"It all depends on who is in the Kremlin,\" Petrov told DW. \"I believe that a 15-year-old child with a ruthless and strong father can easily be perceived as a crown prince, but it is difficult to imagine that he will have enough determination, strength and resources to retain power.\"\n","This article was translated from German\n"," \n","'Nazi-looted art: Is Germany delaying restitution? 03.12.2023'\n","Pablo Picasso: This name alone is usually enough to attract attention in the art world. So it comes as no surprise that a Picasso has now become synonymous with Germany's handling of Nazi-looted art.\n","The painting in question is \"Madame Soler\" from 1903, part of the artist's Blue Period, on display at the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich.\n","For the Bavarian State Painting Collections — the state authority which oversees the Munich museum's collection — it should remain here; in their view, the painting is not looted art.\n","But historian Julius H. Schoeps claims to be the heir of the rightful owner of the artwork. He has said the painting clearly belonged to his great-uncle, the German-Jewish banker and art collector Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy.\n","Schoeps, emeritus professor of modern history at the University of Potsdam, spent years doing his own research in archives around the world and wrote a book about the case, \"Who Owns Picasso's 'Madame Soler'?\"\n","For him, it's clear: The fact that the painting was offered for sale in 1935 was the result of the disenfranchisement and persecution of Jews after Hitler came to power in 1933. \"The fact that Bavaria claims there was no persecution at all until 1935 is completely ahistorical,\" he told DW, indignantly.\n"," \n","It is a dispute that seems predestined for the Advisory Commission on Nazi-Looted Property, founded 20 years ago to make recommendations in complicated cases of restitution disputes.\n","The hitch? It can only begin its work if both parties agree to it.\n","\"In the case of 'Madame Soler,' the families have been fighting for almost 10 years to have the case referred to the commission,\" Hans-Jürgen Papier, the commission president, noted critically. \"But the Free State of Bavaria categorically refuses. We can do nothing.\"\n","As the commission marked its 20th anniversary in September 2023, Papier called for fundamental reforms, aiming to allow victims of Nazi persecution to unilaterally call upon the commission to make recommendations — without waiting for the museums to give their consent. And the commission's recommendations would have to be binding.\n","He said they are currently stuck in a legal vacuum, adding that for now, when museums return paintings, these actions are on a \"voluntary basis, and at best, morally-motivated.\" But, he added, \"The victims have no legal rights.\"\n","Germany signed the Washington Principles on December 3, 1998, in which 43 states undertook to identify \"works of art seized as a result of Nazi persecution\" and to find \"just and fair solutions\" with the owners or their heirs. Germany is not complying, said Schoeps.\n","\"Germany is the country of perpetrators. And in this country in particular, heirs often despair at how they are being dealt with,\" he said. If something is not finally done, Germany's reputation will be damaged internationally, he added.\n","He cited the fact that the heirs of von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy have reached settlements with museums outside Germany on several occasions, including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Guggenheim in New York.\n","Culture Minister Claudia Roth, who came to the Jewish Museum Berlin for the Commission's ceremony, has promised that there will be reforms.\n","She said consultations with the federal states — whose approval is needed in this case in Germany's federal system — would be held before the end of October 2023. A unilateral appeal to the commission will also be possible.\n","For Papier, this does not go far enough. He has called for restitution legislation. Otherwise, the unilateral appeal would not be enforceable at all, believes Papier, who was the former president of the Federal Constitutional Court. \n","The Advisory Commission on Nazi-Looted Property has made 23 recommendations in its 20 years of existence. \"That is too few,\" he insisted, even if the cases in which the commission intervened were groundbreaking.\n","The commission was successful, for example, in settling a dispute over two paintings by the Italian old master Bernardo Bellotto, known as Canaletto.\n","The dispute dragged on for 15 years. The paintings had once belonged to the Jewish department store magnate and important art patron, Max Emden.\n","During the Nazi era, he had to sell them to Adolf Hitler's private collection in a roundabout way — for less than their value, as the Emden family's lawyers argued.\n","After the war, US soldiers found the paintings, which later ended up in the art depot of the Federal Finance Ministry. For a time, they hung in the official residence of the German president, and later in the Military History Museum in Dresden.\n","There, they were convinced Emden had been safe in Switzerland at the time of the sale. It was up to the heirs to prove that Emden had sold the Canalettos \"out of a loss of assets due to persecution.\"\n","Maeva Emden, Emden's great-granddaughter who grew up in Chile, recalls the many bureaucratic hurdles her family had to overcome.\n","The commission eventually recommended the return of the two Canalettos.\n","In 2020, they were auctioned off at Sotheby's. The work \"View of the Zwinger Graben in Dresden\" alone sold for €6 million ($6.4 million).\n","\"The necessary legal support by lawyers over the years made it necessary to sell the pictures,\" says Maeva Emden. She would have preferred to have made the Canalettos available to the Kunsthalle in Hamburg — the former hometown of her great-grandfather. \n","Above all, she says that she wants recognition of \"what Max Emden has done for Hamburg and for Germany. There are so many Jewish families whose memory has been extinguished because they were murdered.\"\n","In 2017, the watercolor \"Marsh Landscape with Red Windmill,\" by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, was returned to the Reynolds family on the commission's recommendation.\n","It had belonged to Jewish entrepreneur and art collector Max Rüdenberg.\n","The 87-year-old Vernon Reynolds is Rüdenberg's grandson.\n","\"What are paintings?\" he asked. He would much rather talk about the loss of people than about the restitution of artworks. \"Works of art can be returned, people can't,\" he told DW. \"I lost my father and my grandparents on both sides. Uncles, aunts — all lost forever.\"\n","Vernon Reynolds, born in Berlin in 1935, survived with his mother — thanks in part to his grandfather's art collection. Rüdenberg and his wife Greta sold what they could to get the family out of the country.\n","Vernon's brother and sister made it to England on one of the Kindertransports, which evacuated children from Nazi-controlled territory. His mother also managed to escape with Vernon, who was 3 years old at the time. His grandparents Max and Greta Rüdenberg, however, remained in Germany, and were murdered in Theresienstadt. Vernon Reynolds' father died in Auschwitz.\n","This article was originally written in German.

The baby girl was named Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia.\n","As Maria Callas, she would launch a stage career just 17 years later and become arguably the greatest opera diva of all time within the next decade.\n","Today, in the centenary year of her birth, Maria Callas is more present than ever.\n","To mark the event, the world is celebrating Callas. Large and small opera houses are hosting gala evenings devoted to her, publishers are presenting dozens of new publications and record labels are digging out their archival treasures.\n","Performance artist Marina Abramovic pays tribute to the diva in her latest work, \"7 Deaths of Maria Callas,\" which explores the skillful way Callas performed her stage heroines' deaths.\n","In his upcoming biopic, \"Maria,\" Chilean director Pablo Larrain reconstructs the real last days of the lonely star's life, shortly before her death in Paris in 1977 at the age of just 53. Larrain has cast Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to play the title role.\n","The film isn't set for release until 2024.\n","But just in time for her centenary, a Callas Museum will be opening in Athens, whose conservatory accepted the musical prodigy as a student when she was just 14.\n","UNESCO included the centenary of Maria Callas' birth in its list of anniversaries, as her audio legacy is undoubtedly part of intangible World Heritage.\n","And finally, in the summer of 2023, a €2 coin featuring an iconic Callas portrait came into circulation.\n","\"Why is Maria Callas the only singer of a past era who is still present, not only in music, but in theater, film, fine arts and even gossip columns?\" That's the question posed by Eva Gesine Baur, author of a carefully researched biography of the diva published in German earlier this year. \"What allowed her to become unique?\"\n","Bauer isn't the first to ask those questions. Many have attempted to explain the Callas phenomenon over the years.\n","In 1958, Italian music critic and journalist Teodoro Celli got to the heart of at least one aspect when he wrote that in Callas' singing, \"instinct and temperament merge in an unparalleled art of performance.\"\n","As early as 1953, director Franco Zeffirelli, who experienced Callas as Medea at La Scala, described her impact as \"opera B.C. and opera A.C. — before Callas and after Callas.\"\n","In her fewer than 30 years on stage, the indefatigable soprano performed 47 roles, revolutionizing the art of opera in the process.\n","Three of them are particularly well known: Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor,\" Puccini's \"Tosca\" and of course, \"Norma\" — which Callas believed Bellini had written for her, despite the fact that she was not even born until almost a century after his death.\n","Callas saw herself primarily as a singing actress. Callas biographer Eva Gesine Bauer says that approach allowed her to \"save opera from a gradual demise into indifference.\" Callas herself was never indifferent to any aspect of her performance, \"not a note, not a breath, not a gesture, not a character trait of the women she portrayed,\" Bauer adds.\n","But that explains only part of the diva's enduring appeal. Curiosity about Maria Callas, the woman, is at least as great as the interest in her as an artist.\n","It would be easy to tell the story of Maria Callas' life through infamous anecdotes and scandals, especially since they have all been well-documented in the gossip pages of the world press: stormy disagreements with artistic directors, bickering with fellow singers, in particular with her main rival, Renata Tebaldi (Callas found comparisons between her and Tebaldi as apt as comparing champagne to Coca-Cola — where she, of course, represented the high-end sparkling wine).\n","Her chronic struggles with her domineering mother were as fascinating to the press as her marriage to wealthy industrialist Giovanni Battista Meneghini, who was twice her age. Gossip pages reported on her jet-set lifestyle, cancelled performances, angry outbursts and poor eyesight.\n","Callas was very nearsighted, but was too vain to wear her thick glasses on stage. So directors had to find other solutions to help their star soloist find her way around the stage. Luchino Visconti, who directed her in \"La traviata\" in Milan, had perfumed handkerchiefs placed on the stage so the singer could use the scent to hit her marks.\n","Then there was a long and, by today's standards, toxic relationship with shipping magnate Aristotle \"Ari\" Onassis — whose marriage to presidential widow Jacqueline Kennedy Callas is said to have read about in the press while she was still his partner.\n","There was also the mid-career weight loss, from more than 90 kilograms to around 60 kilograms within just a few months, which some observers have blamed for Callas' vocal decline. According to legend, that weight loss was achieved by consuming tapeworm eggs for breakfast, washed down with a glass of champagne. In reality, she underwent weight-reducing hormone therapy, the most modern method she could find — highly efficient but at least as bad for her health as the tapeworm would have been.\n","Maria Callas died alone in her Paris apartment, leaving behind an estate containing some 40 mink coats, 250 cashmere sweaters, countless handbags and several drawers of full-length velvet gloves, many never worn.\n","But does collecting all these anecdotes bring one any closer to understanding why Maria Callas remains such a phenomenon? \"Of course not,\" says biographer Eva Gesine Bauer, who adds that all the rumors and legends tend to present Callas as a victim of her overbearing mother, of sensationalistic reporters, of a faithless lover. But Bauer says that gives a skewed picture of this remarkable woman, who was never a victim, neither on stage or off.\n","She exercised self-determination in her life just as she did in her singing — decisive and assured down to the most subtle vocal nuance.\n","\"In a way, she is the most modern of all women,\" wrote Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini about Callas. \"But inside her lives a woman of antiquity, strange, mysterious and magical, which triggers terrible conflicts within her.\"\n","The wild, the imperfect and the broken are what takes Maria Callas from the minutiae of her private life and the times in which she lived and makes her what she was and still is — one of the greatest artists of all time.\n","This article was originally published in German.\n","\"Female Arab filmmakers' biggest challenge? Western preconceptions 01.12.2023\"\n","The mood at this week's Marrakech International Film Festival may have been slightly subdued. Organizers at the 20th edition of the annual festival, one of the largest in the Arab world, deliberately toned down the red carpet glamour and canceled the usual public screenings in the city's iconic central square, partially due to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip as well as the recent earthquake at home.\n","But it was also true that the female filmmakers who work in the Middle East and showed their movies at Marrakech had something to celebrate. Overall they're doing very well, perhaps ­even better than their counterparts in Europe and North America, when it comes to representation and gender equity.\n","\"It is not just by chance that there are more and more female filmmakers in the region,\" French-Tunisian director Sonia Ben Slama told DW in Marrakech. \"It's because for a long time, these female stories were told by men. There was a need to reclaim our voices in cinema.\"\n","Ben Slama's documentary, \"Machtat,\" which screened at Marrakech, is a prime example. For five years, Ben Slama followed a trio of women who work as wedding singers in Tunisia, gaining insights into their turbulent private and professional lives.\n","But there are also less ephemeral factors making female Arab filmmakers more visible and more successful.\n","Streaming platforms like Netflix are spending more on localized content — that is, Arabic-language content for Arab audiences — supporting women in film financially and logistically, as well as offering a wider platform for their work. This is happening as the number of subscribers to on-demand streaming services in the Middle East and North Africa grows, from around 5 million in 2017 to 21 million in 2022.\n","Arab-made films now regularly compete at the world's biggest film festivals — Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Sundance — and European co-productions are common. Additionally, many Middle Eastern film festivals and their attendant production platforms now work towards equality. In fact, many have quotas for female-led productions.\n","In 2019, the Cairo Film Festival became the first Arab film festival to sign an international charter for gender parity at such events. The Doha Film Institute in Qatar has regularly awarded almost half of all production grants to women.\n","And this week in Marrakech, of 25 international production teams selected for mentorship at the Atlas Workshops, there were 11 female directors and 12 female producers involved. \n","\"In Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon, approximately 25% of all new directors are females. In Qatar, nearly 60% of emerging filmmakers are women,\" Fatma Hassan al-Remaihi, head of the Doha Film Institute noted  in a 2019 post for the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank. In comparison, according to the latest data from Statista, only 15% of film directors in the US were women in 2022.\n","In fact, the highest-grossing Arabic language film ever — the Oscar-nominated \"Capernaum\" — was directed by a woman, Lebanese filmmaker Nadine Labaki. \n","But even as all this is happening, female Arab filmmakers are facing some unexpected challenges. Audiences everywhere, whether European or Arab, have certain expectations about their work.\n","\"Over the past two decades, the most commercially successful Arab films in Europe closely adhered to specific formulas: stories of terrorism, poverty, female oppression,\" Egyptian film critic and festival programmer Joseph Fahim wrote in a 2020 review of Arab cinema for the European Institute of the Mediterranean. \"In other words, films that ratify Western viewers' perceptions and prejudices of the Arab world rather than defy them.\" \n","During test screenings of \"Machtat,\" Ben Slama recalls how viewers were quite surprised about the behavior of the women in her documentary. \"I felt they were waiting for the women to be good mothers, or victims, or to adhere to other stereotypes,\" she explained. \"But they were more complex than that. They might not react the way we expect them to. And that's important,\" Ben Slama argues, \"because it shows their complexity, their humanity.\"\n","And then it doesn't matter whether the story is set in Tunisia or Europe, everyone relates, the director said.\n","\"It's about making films that have a universal appeal,\" agreed French Moroccan director, Sofia Alaoui. She presented her debut feature film, \"Animalia,\" at the Marrakech Film Festival this week too. The movie is unusual, a science-fiction thriller starring a young pregnant woman and her wealthy family, psychedelic aliens, stoic countryfolk, the stunning Moroccan landscape and a cast of birds, dogs and sheep all behaving very badly.\n","\"Actually, I never was really inspired by Arab cinema,\" Alaoui continued. \"My favorite films were more Asian, or Danish, or from Finland. So what I'm trying to do is bring the cinema that I love, but in an Arabic way.\"\n","Alaoui ran into audience preconceptions too. Some people criticized the film, she said, because it was not as focused on the Moroccan scenery or village dwellers as her earlier short films had been. It is almost like some audiences, particularly those in Europe, prefer to see an exotic or almost fetishized version of Arabs on the big screen, she argued.\n","It can be a problem, Tania El Khoury, the producer of Ben Slama's film \"Machtat,\" confirmed. Arab-directed films do well in art house cinemas or at festivals but it's harder to get wider distribution, especially if a director tackles a topic that discomforts Arab audiences and surprises European viewers. \"Then the movie gets stuck,\" she said.\n","\"I have seen female directors criticized by European audiences because they told stories about women that are free, independent and different from what the audience excepted from Middle Eastern movie makers,\" El Khoury noted. \n","\"The Moroccan film industry is very dynamic and we want to tell local stories,\" added Moroccan director Asmae El Moudir, who also screened her film, \"The Mother of All Lies,\" at Marrakech this week; her unique documentary is Morocco's candidate for the Oscars this year and won several prizes at Cannes. \"Many of us are friends. But we are also very different people and we have different ways of working. That should be accepted.\"\n","\"Sometimes I think the European industry patronizes us,\" Alaoui said. \"You know, here's a film festival, here's some diversity [from the Middle East], here are the same storylines about emancipation. I find that so boring. But there are so many more of us [in the industry] now. There are so many more options, so many directors. And the world should accept that we are much more diverse than they think.\"\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'NFT bubble has truly burst, but do they have a future? 01.12.2023'\n","Many strange things happened in the global economy during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, but few as curious as the NFT boom of 2021.\n","Barely anyone knew what a non-fungible token (NFT) was at the start of that year. By the end of it, more than $40 billion (€36.6 billion) had been spent on blockchain-recorded digital assets and artwork. That made the sector almost as valuable as the global art market itself.\n","If 2021 was the boom, then 2022 was the bust. In January 2022, the market reached its dizzying height but by September of that year, trading volumes had fallen by a gigantic 97%.\n","The NFT crash was part of the wider cryptocurrency sector wipeout, which saw an astonishing $2 trillion loss of value.\n","So, are NFTs simply dead, or is there some kind of future for them?\n","In early November 2023, OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, announced it was laying off half its workforce. Then there was a bizarre event at a promotional event in Hong Kong for the \"Bored Ape Yacht Club,\" one of the best-known NFT collections. Dozens of people reported \"severe eye burn\" after attending the event, which featured heavy use of ultraviolet lighting.\n","None of that is good news yet there have also been signs recently of a very modest revival in the battered sector, with trading volumes edging up recently after falling steadily throughout 2023.\n","When the NFT boom took off in the summer of 2021, Andrea Barbon was one of the many people intrigued by the potential of the new innovation.\n","He quickly created and sold his own collection, a set of computer-generated fractal images.\n","\"This venture sparked in me a profound curiosity and the willingness to delve deeper into NFTs,\" Barbon, a finance professor at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland  and the HSG Center for Financial Services Innovation, told DW.\n","\"My fascination with the blend of art, technology and finance that NFTs represent motivated me to study them in extensive detail, exploring their potential impact on various sectors and their role in the future of digital ownership and creativity.\"\n","From the start, many were dismissive of NFTs. Bill Gates famously said they were \"100% based on the 'greater fool theory'\" — the idea that one can make money through the purchase of overvalued, fundamentally worthless assets  as long as there is a \"greater fool\" who will come along and pay even more.\n","\"Obviously, expensive digital images of monkeys are going to improve the world immensely,\" Gates joked in an apparent reference to the Bored Ape collection.\n","Yet NFTs took off. Perhaps the unique circumstances of the time, when the pandemic meant people around the world were spending unusual amounts of time online and at home, played a part.\n","Barbon says the cryptocurrency boom, in full flow in 2021, fueled excitement in NFTs while user-friendly platforms such as OpenSea made it very easy for people to buy and trade them.\n","Then there was the exclusivity factor, cultivated by celebrity purchases and the creation of NFT clubs.\n","\"The allure of NFTs was further amplified by their novelty, the promise of high returns and their role as status symbols within the crypto community,\" Barbon said. \"This combination of technological innovation, market dynamics and cultural factors created a perfect storm that propelled the NFT boom.\"\n","For Barbon and his colleague Angelo Ranaldo at the Swiss Finance Institute, NFTs represented a fascinating field of study. As part of their academic research, they examined more than 15 million NFT transactions, worth around $18 billion, between January 2021 and September 2022. They came to the conclusion that the whole market represented a bubble.\n","\"We observed a pronounced tendency for bubble-like behaviors in the NFT market,\" Barbon said. \"This was characterized by rapid price surges, often doubling within days or even hours, followed by steep declines. These fluctuations offered significant returns for investors but also posed substantial risks.\"\n","Something else they noticed was that some investors showed an ability to consistently capitalize on the market's volatility, making significant amounts of money, while others displayed more reckless behavior.\n","\"The market experienced inflated valuations driven more by speculative fervor than underlying fundamentals,\" he found.\n","Some NFTs have had stunning collapses in value. The Bored Ape collection for example, which became especially popular with celebrities, has lost more than 90% of its value, amounting to several billion dollars. The singer Justin Bieber and the Brazilian footballer Neymar are among those to have spent around $1 million each on Bored Ape NFTs, only to see the value all but disappear.\n","The fallout from the celebrity NFT craze continues to this day. This week, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was hit with a class-action lawsuit seeking at least $1 billion in damages for his role in promoting NFTs issued by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\n","As a result, there is deep underlying skepticism about the market. But Barbon says it can still have a future, especially if its returns to its origins as a marketplace for digital artists.\n","\"They are not just a technological novelty but a groundbreaking innovation with practical applications,\" he said. \"NFTs have revolutionized the market for digital art, providing contemporary artists specializing in digital media a platform to authenticate and monetize their creations.\"\n","He also sees other possible uses for NFTs beyond the art world in realms like digital identity and the ownership of virtual assets.\n","Yet the bubble and the huge losses incurred means there will be a big question mark over NFTs for a long time to come.\n","Edited by: Tim Rooks\n","\n","'How Beyonce became a pop culture phenomenon 01.12.2023'\n","Beyonce keeps pushing boundaries and rewriting the rules of the music industry, all while embodying empowered self-representation and Black culture.\n","Released worldwide on December 1, the concert documentary \"Renaissance: A Film By Beyonce\" not only features the dazzling musical acts of her record-breaking Renaissance World Tour, but also goes behind the scenes to reveal how the show was put together.\n","Throughout, the film shows how the superstar is the one who calls the shots.\n","But how did she become such a monument of pop culture in the first place?\n","Born in Houston, Texas, on September 4, 1981, Beyonce Giselle Knowles won her first school talent show at age 7.\n","Two years later, she entered the pop world as part of the all-girls' group Girls Tyme.\n","The band failed to meet expectations, but Beyonce's father left his job as a successful Xerox sales agent to become the girls' manager.

These include upheavals in civilization such as World War II and the Holocaust, the ideological confrontation between East and West during the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, to name just the most dramatic. They all kept the world on tenterhooks. At the same time, they inspired artists, gave them cause for reflection and often for redefinition. Some broke new ground.\n","This becomes particularly clear in the exhibition's \"Existential Experiences\" section. It shows how artists reacted with deep uncertainty to the horrors of war and the cultural collapse of the Holocaust after 1945. Fear and inner turmoil are reflected in the spindly, overlong figures of Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, for example. The unfathomable black holes on the gloomy reliefs by US artist Lee Bontecou cry out for orientation, as does the surrealism attached to the \"articulated doll\" by Dresden artist Wilhelm Lachnit (1899-1962).\n","The political and military division of the world between East and West, the struggle between ideologies for sovereignty of interpretation and propaganda, provides a completely different test of endurance. This can also be seen in the visual arts. An artistic battle for direction breaks out between figurative and abstract. In Western Europe and the United States, younger artists turn to new, abstract forms of expression. The German artist K.O. Götz (1914-2017), for example, throws paint onto the canvas and blurs it with a squeegee to create abstract, informal structures. The Americans Mark Rothko (1903-1970) and Morris Louis (1912-1962) painted large, sometimes monochrome, color fields.\n","In the GDR and other socialist countries, on the other hand, Socialist Realism was raised to the highest level. It was supposed to show the toiling workers and farmers as they were; state art as propaganda. But there were also GDR artists who defied the political guidelines, such as Harald Metzkes or Werner Tübke (1929-2004). And figurative art also lives on in many studios in the West, for example in the paintings and sculptures of Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) or Henry Moore (1898-1986).\n","In the field of tension between politics and society, art finds its role. \"Art often functions like a seismograph in that it can pick up on trends earlier than elsewhere,\" says curator Maike Steinkamp.\n","A naked Marina Abramovic dancing until she drops, for example, or Rebecca Horn, whose constricted naked woman with a unicorn on her head strides through the landscape, become pioneers of women's liberation. The Neue Nationalgalerie's new permanent exhibition, which runs through till September 28, 2025, shows all of this and so much more.\n","\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'German activists launch Black Friday campaign against Amazon 24.11.2023'\n","The German artist-activist Peng! Collective greeted the traditional shopping frenzy of Black Friday Week with a campaign aimed at the online retailer Amazon and what one Peng member called its \"Soviet\" business model.\n","In keeping with Peng's ambition to create an \"explosive concoction of activism, hacking, and art,\" the campaign is a four-pronged attack: A Black Friday protest outside the \"Amazon Tower\" building in Berlin, an online petition, a satirical Amazon-themed \"circus\" created by the Rimini Protokoll theater group, and an \"Amazon Leaks\" page, where the company's employees can report alleged abuses at the company.\n","But, according to Jean Peters, Peng spokesperson, investigative journalist and veteran of several Peng stunts, the reported working conditions are just a symptom of the basic problem: Amazon's colossally successful business model.\n","This, he claims, is unique, as it relies on monopolizing access to customers, forcing small retailers to give up huge percentages to sell on its marketplace and, above all, exploiting an army of small subcontractors whose employees have only limited-time contracts and few workers' rights.\n","There are well-known issues with subcontractor chains: Delivery companies like Amazon, Hermes, and FedEx use subcontractors who often contract even smaller companies. Some of these operations, according to Rory Linton, spokesman for Germany's second largest trade union Verdi, are in fierce competition to undercut each other, and are so small that they only employ two or three people and only exist for a short time. \"They know they can't fulfill the contracts if they have correct health and safety and pay a decent wage, so the big companies get rid of the responsibility,\" he said.\n","Linton describes cases reported to the union where subcontractors did not allow their workers to turn on the Amazon app that records their working hours for the first and last hours of their shift. Not only that, Amazon stipulates that its \"Freight Partners\" in Germany can only operate a maximum of ten trucks, which, according to Verdi, both restricts any chance of competition and ensures that delivery drivers cannot organize effectively.\n","\"With subcontractors there are almost no checks and balances in terms of workers' rights, health and safety,\" Linton told DW. \"Often workers get less than minimum wage.\"\n","Verdi wants an outright ban on subcontractors in the postal package industry, a proposal that has already been echoed by some of Germany's state governments.\n","There has been a backlash in the industry. Frank Huster, head of the logistics industry association DSLV, which represents big hauling companies, says a ban would only have a disruptive effect on supply chains. \"Any freight forwarder subcontracts transport companies on a regular basis. If precarious employment relationships are found at transport companies, this must be remedied in the internal relationship [between employer and employee] and not by a general ban on commissioning transport service providers,\" he told DW.\n","A ban would be a very bad idea, according to Sebastian Hassler, who has spent 20 years running several small and medium-sized logistics firms whose clients include Amazon and other major companies.\n","\"That won't solve the problem,\" he told DW. \"Just because there are a few black sheep, who I believe are a minority — to ban the entire industry because of that! That's my livelihood, and we pay taxes and social contributions and treat people decently.\"\n","He also thinks banning the contracts like the ones he has with Amazon would only concentrate more power in the larger companies' hands, as it would force delivery drivers to work directly for the major corporations.\n","Hassler says there's plenty to criticize about Amazon: \"I'm also critical of the fact that Amazon has this market dominance, and it's clear that it's getting tougher for mid-sized companies,\" he said. \"And we know that Amazon pays very little tax, and I don't agree with that either.\"\n","And yet: \"If I compare the big players, Amazon is actually the fairest,\" he added. \"Amazon tells us how much we have to pay our drivers, and it's way over the minimum wage. And we have to prove the number of hours they worked.\"\n","He also says that in his experience, Amazon is among the quickest of the big companies to cancel contracts if compliance rules are broken.\n","The problem with subcontractors, according to industry representatives DW spoke to, had more to do with the state's failure to catch law-breaking companies. \n","Marten Bosselmann, head of the German Parcel and Express Association (BIEK), argues that there are already plenty of workers' rights protection laws in place. \"The big package delivery service providers are not law enforcement authorities,\" he told DW. \"We would like to see more controls and the people who break the rules, who don't pay their workers properly, they have to be taken out of circulation.\"\n","Activists, meanwhile, insist that Amazon's market dominance and all-consuming business model — funneling retailers and customers through its platform while keeping subcontractors small — suffocates competition.\n","\"Amazon is a kind of microcosm of a radical planned economy to concentrate profits for a few people,\" said Jean Peters of Peng! \"With Amazon we have a planned economy with total surveillance of all the workers and all the products, in a way the Soviets could only dream of. And all of that is done not for the redistribution of wealth, but for profit.\"\n","Amazon rejects all these claims, saying that it is in competition with several other major retailers, and that its marketplace model actually helps small businesses.\n","\"The fact is that Amazon has created millions of good jobs while supporting hundreds of thousands of small businesses around the world,\" an Amazon spokesperson told DW in a statement. \"We offer our employees good wages and benefits, attractive career opportunities and a modern and safe working environment for all.\"\n","Olaf Scholz's government is drawing up a new postal services law that will apparently include a crackdown on subcontractor abuses. \"Non-transparent sub-subcontractor relationships and repeated violations of labor and social law requirements give reason to expand the legal instruments,\" the Economy Ministry said in January 2023.\n","Some 30,000 postal workers took to the streets of Berlin in October 2023 to demand action, and Amazon workers have gone on strike on Black Friday before.\n","And there is a precedent for action on subcontractor abuses: The government moved fast to crack down on meat industry subcontractors after a major scandal in 2020 revealed the exploitation of workers at the meat processing company Tönnies.\n","Jean Peters is not holding his breath, though. He believes the Green Party, responsible for the Economy Industry, would like to see stronger regulations on subcontractors, but fears that the governing coalition's Free Democrats (FDP), led by Finance Minister Christian Lindner, will try to protect Amazon's interests. \"We'll see,\" he said.\n","While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

One of the latest productions is Netflix's German historical drama \"The Empress,\"  which tells the story of her early life and which picked up an International Emmy for best drama series on November 20.\n","The series, which also looks at the famous love story between Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph and Elisabeth von Wittelsbach popularly known as Sisi, competed against productions from South Korea, Argentina and the United Kingdom. After their victory, the series team together with author Katharina Eyssen and producer Jochen Laube cheered wildly for minutes in front of the global press.\n","\"It's surreal,\" Eyssen told the German Press Agency, dpa, saying she couldn't believe the success of her series. She added that the emotions and dynamics of the family story of \"The Empress\" was what most probably fascinated the audience and jury.\n","\"The depth of characters convinced people. This story is not about a princess marrying a king. It’s about a rebellious young woman,\" said Eyssen in her acceptance speech.  \n","\"We are incredibly honored,\" Laube said after receiving the award. The entire team put their hearts into the making and is now delighted with the great success, especially in view of the \"clever, likable and extremely eloquent competition.\" According to Laube, more than 100 million people worldwide have watched at least parts of the series. A second season is now in the works.\n","Three other German nominees — all of them dealing with Germany's Nazi past — were also in the running at the International Emmys but came away empty-handed.  \n","Among them was the DW documentary \"Classical Music under the Swastika\" that shows why classical music was so important to Hitler and the Nazis. The film's two main characters represent musical life under the Nazis in very different ways: Star conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler made a pact with the Nazis, while the Jewish cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch survived in a concentration camp thanks to her musical talent.\n","It was the first DW production to be nominated at the International Emmy Awards. The documentary lost in the category \"Best Cultural Program\" against a Canadian documentary about actress and singer Buffy Sainte-Marie.\n","\n","Another German production titled \"Nazi Hunters\" competed with the documentary \"Mariupol: The People's Story\" about the fate of the war victims in Ukraine. \"Meet Anne Frank\" lost out to nature series \"Built to Survive\" under the category best non-fiction program for children.\n","The International Emmy Award is a television prize presented by the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences as part of the Emmy Awards.

It was an insane conversation.\"\n","This and other stories of the Jewish cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch and the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, who made a pact with the Nazis, provide an insight into German musical life from 1933 to 1945. All this is captured in the DW documentary \"Music under the Swastika: The Maestro and the Cellist of Auschwitz.\"\n","This documentary has now been nominated under the \"Arts Programming\" category of the 51st International Emmy Awards that will be handed out on November 20 in New York. It is the first Emmy nomination in the history of DW.\n","The International Emmy Award is a television prize presented by the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences as part of the Emmy Awards. With the International Emmy Award, the organization annually honors the best television programs produced and broadcast outside the USA and is considered one of the most important television awards worldwide.\n","\"Classical Music under the Swastika\" shows why classical music was so important to Hitler and the Nazis. The 90-minute documentary by director Christian Berger was produced in the Culture and Documentaries department under the direction of Rolf Rische and Tim Klimeš. Frauke Sandig was the editor in charge and the film was produced by 3B-Produktion Berlin.\n","In an interview in the documentary written and directed by Christian Berger, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch recalls how the cello saved her life.\n","She was accepted into the 56-piece orchestra of the women's camp. \"We were children and amateurs,\" she says.\n","Alma Rose, the niece of Jewish composer Gustav Mahler, who was labeled \"degenerate\" by the Nazis, arranged pieces for the ragtag musical troupe herself. Marches were especially in demand; the orchestra played for the workers at the gate of the women's camp each morning and evening, even in freezing cold weather.\n","Although the cellist was spared from doing punitive manual labor, she did not feel safe. \"They won't send us to the gas chamber only as long as they want music. It's just a reprieve!\" she thought.\n","But why did the Nazis even bother to play music for the prisoners they murdered? \"This mentality is so perverse that it's hard to comprehend, but it's essential: Music and the arts were used as part of the murder machine,\" Norman Lebrecht, a British music journalist, told DW. \"And the whole of the musical establishment and the music profession in Germany either turned a blind eye or collaborated.\"\n","Lebrecht has been researching the role of classical music under the Nazis for many years. \"Culture was one of the ways to justify Nazi rule in Germany\" — it was a sort of cover for the Nazis, he said. \"They could say, we are a cultural nation, we are a cultural people. You couldn't possibly suspect that we're doing something that was uncultural.\"\n","Hitler himself was aware of the power of music. \"It is certain that music is to be addressed as the greatest shaper of feelings and sensations that move the mind,\" he told the NSDAP Party Congress in 1938.\n","The cynical reality was that, though Jewish composers and musicians were ostracized and murdered, Nazis such as concentration camp doctor Josef Mengele had classical music pieces played to them by Jews including Lasker-Wallfisch in Auschwitz.\n","Even Hitler's private record collection is said to have included recordings by Jewish musicians.\n","The DW music documentary addresses these contradictions and, for the first time, summarizes classical music events as they related to the Third Reich in their entirety.\n","The film's two main characters represent musical life under the Nazis in very different ways: Star conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler made a pact with the Nazis, while Lasker-Wallfisch survived thanks to her musical talent.\n","This dramatic period in history is brought to life through historical film footage that has been digitally restored and carefully colorized.\n","The documentary includes scenes of Hitler at the Bayreuth Festival, Furtwängler's birthday concert for the Führer, composer Richard Strauss at the opening of the 1936 Olympic Games, and footage of cellist Lasker-Wallfisch being interviewed by British journalists after the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she was deported shortly before the end of the war.\n","At the documentary's premiere in Berlin on November 9, 2022, Anita's son, Raphael Wallfisch, told DW that it took years for their mother to reveal to her children what she had been through under the Nazis.\n","He also said that his mother was saddened and worried by the resurgence of antisemitism: \"She believed that the Holocaust had taught lessons to the world and changed it forever, but that is unfortunately not the case.\"\n","\"Every nationalist movement tries to spread an idea of how a nation should be,\" said Simon Wallfisch after the film screening. The Nazis would have done everything to subject music to their ideology and to ban anything Jewish.\n","Even today, works by artists such as the composer Viktor Ullmann, who was killed in Auschwitz, receive too little attention, he added.\n","Lasker-Wallfisch can still remember the day the camp was liberated very well. The then 19-year-old wanted the whole world to know about the atrocities committed against Jews. \"What I was trying to describe was actually unbelievable. How do you describe Bergen-Belsen? You walk on corpses. It's impossible to describe.\"\n","In 1946, the cellist emigrated to Britain. She did not visit Germany again until 1994.

claims 17.11.2023'\n","Following the scandal-hit 2022 edition of the documenta art exhibition, claims of antisemitism have again surfaced as preparations begin for the next installment of the event, which is held every five years.\n","After Indian curator, art critic and poet Ranjit Hoskote was appointed to the six-member finding committee to choose the artistic director of documenta 16 — to be held in 2027 — it emerged that he had signed a 2019 statement by the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. \n","The Palestinian-led BDS movement promotes boycotts and economic sanctions against Israel \"to end international support for Israel's oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law.\" BDS was designated antisemitic by the German parliament in 2019. \n","Claudia Roth, the German minister of state for culture, denounced the BDS letter signed by Hoskote as \"clearly antisemitic,\" a claim based in part on its calling Israel a \"settler-colonial apartheid state.\" BDS is modeled on the boycott movement that campaigned against apartheid in South Africa.\n","Hoskote has since resigned from the committee, and refused to distance himself from the statement he signed — as demanded by documenta managing director Andreas Hoffmann.\n","Israeli artist and writer Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger also resigned from the committee after her request for the process to be slowed in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks was rejected.\n","Now, the rest of the committee — Simon Njami, Gong Yan, Kathrin Rhomberg, and María Ines Rodriguez — have announced their \"collective resignation from this honorable task.\" \n","In a statement released on Friday, November 17, the former committee members justified their resignation in light of what they called an \"emotional and intellectual climate of over-simplification of complex realities\" in regards to accusations of antisemitism at documenta. \n","This related not only to concerns over support for the BDS movement, but months of debate about depictions of antisemitic cliches in the works of Ruangrupa, the Indonesian curatorial group behind last year's documenta festival.\n","\n","While the outgoing committee members acknowledged that \"Germany has distinct social and political responsibilities,\" and that \"alarming signs of deep-rooted antisemitism are once again making themselves felt around the world,\" they feared the issue has been \"misused for opinion politics.\"\n","\"In the current circumstances we do not believe that there is a space in Germany for an open exchange of ideas and the development of complex and nuanced artistic approaches that documenta artists and curators deserve,\" stated the resignation letter.\n","Culture Minister Roth responded to the resignations on Friday, saying that \"we now need a credible new start, for which documenta must also be repositioned with regard to its organizational structures.\"\n","In Rajit Hoskote's resignation letter published on November 13, he wrote that he had \"publicly spoken out against the intellectual and cultural boycott of Israel.\" He also expressed his \"wish to restate\" his \"highest regard for the Jewish people,\" and his \"deepest empathy with their historic sufferings and admiration for their glorious cultural achievements.\"\n","But he also claimed that criticism of Israel is not antisemitic.\n","\"I am being asked to accept a sweeping and untenable definition of antisemitism that conflates the Jewish people with the Israeli state, and that, correspondingly, misrepresents any expression of sympathy with the Palestinian people as support for Hamas,\" he continued.\n","\"My conscience does not permit me to accept this sweeping definition and these strictures on human empathy,\" Hoskote wrote.\n","In her criticism of the BDS letter signed by Hoskote, Roth also questioned the federal government's financial involvement in documenta.\n","Subsidies for the international art exhibition in Kassel, central Germany, will only be provided, Roth said, \"if there is a joint plan and visible reform steps.\" These include \"clear responsibilities\" and \"a genuine opportunity for the federal government to participate and set standards to prevent antisemitism and discrimination.\"\n","The federal government's contribution to documenta 15 in 2022 amounted to €3.5 million ($3.8 million), while the two main shareholders — the city of Kassel and the state of Hesse — contributed €21.5 million.\n","\n","On November 10, Israeli artist Lichtenberg Ettinger, who is based in Paris and Tel Aviv, also resigned from the documenta finding committee.\n","Following the terror attacks by Hamas on October 7, she said it was not possible for her to participate in the selection of the next artistic director after a failed request for the process to be slowed down. She had not been able to personally attend a meeting of the committee a few days after the Hamas attacksafter she was told her flight had been canceled.\n","In her resignation letter, the artist described a feeling of being \"paralyzed under rockets\" when attending a meeting via video.\n","She described \"the details of the massacre committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians, women, and babies ... being streamed on my screen during our lunch and coffee breaks, just a few days after the massacre by Hamas that began the tragic war.\"\n","\"The situation in the Middle East is tragic from all angles,\" she added. \"Innocent civilians suffered and died, and my heart cries for each dead on all sides: Palestinians and Israelis.

But, as the movie's tagline says, only time will reveal who is a songbird, and who is a snake. \n","Most of \"The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\" was shot in Germany, with some of its capital's most impressive landmarks standing in for the fading grandeur of post-war Panem. \n","Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee is a monumental boulevard that was designed to showcase the prestige of communist East Germany, and from 1949 to 1961 was called Stalinallee, after Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.\n","Strausberger Platz, an impressive roundabout on the boulevard, can be recognized 30 seconds within in the trailer — with several CGI elements adding to its totalitarian allure.\n","Berlin's Olympiastadion in Charlottenburg is now home to the Hertha BSC football team, but the stadium was first built by the Nazis for the 1936 Summer Olympics. \n","The awesome, imposing building, with its neo-classical columns — a Nazi take on Greek architecture — has served as a backdrop for several films in the past, including the Marvel movie \"Captain America: Civil War\" and the Bollywood action epic \"Don 2,\" starring Shah Rukh Khan.\n","It's easy to see why \"The Hunger Games\" producers found it a good fit for evoking a tyrannical nation struggling to be free. \n","Rachel Zegler posted a picture of herself in costume outside the twin columns of the Olympiastadion's East Gate. \n","The Veterinary Anatomy Theater, part of Berlin's Humboldt University, was constructed in 1790 as a veterinary medical training facility.\n","The building, designed by architect Carl Gotthard Langhans, is now a protected landmark. Since the restoration was completed in 2012, it is open to the public and often used for art exhibitions.\n","The central building, with its domed and staged lecture hall, is a masterpiece of Prussian early classicism and proved irresistible for \"The Hunger Games\" scouts.\n","Interestingly, the 2005 sci-fi film \"Aeon Flux,\" starring Charlize Theron, used the exact same location for one of its scenes. \n","A crematorium might seem an unlikely spot to shoot a Hollywood blockbuster, but this building, designed by the renowned German architect Fritz Eisel and opened in 1999, is both visually stunning and emotionally evocative.\n","The Crematorium Baumschulenweg's minimalist modernist style is meant to create a functional and dignified space for people to mourn and say farewell to their departed love ones. For a filmmaker, it can also evoke a near-future world, just a few steps removed from our own. \n","\"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\" crisscrossed Germany to find shooting locations suitable for the luxurious Capitol and the wastelands of the outer districts.\n","The film shot some exteriors at the Landschaftspark in Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia in western Germany. The site of a former coal plant shut down in 1985, the area has been turned into a public park with its industrial machinery — including a 230-foot (70-meter) platform surveying the landscape — open to the public. \n","In eastern Germany, the cast and crew shot some interior scenes at the Völkerschlachtdenkmal, the Monument to the Battle of the Nations, in Leipzig. \n","One of the largest war memorials in Europe, the monument was erected in 1913 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. A coalition of armies from Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden, led by Tsar Alexander I of Russia and the Austrian general Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, defeated Napoleon's troops.\n","There were German soldiers fighting on both sides and the battle, which marked the beginning of Napoleon's downfall, is often used as emblematic of the senselessness of war itself. \n","Germany is not the only country playing Panem in the new \"Hunger Games\" film. The film also shot several scenes in Poland, notably at the Centennial Hall in Wroclaw, a grand and suitably imposing concrete landmark whose central feature is a 75-foot-high (23-meter-high) dome topped with a lantern of glass and steel. \n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'Israeli artists put Hamas hostages in Gaza in the spotlight 13.11.2023'\n","\"The photos of the hostages are all around the world,\" says Yifat Gurion, curator of the annual art fair Freshpaint in Tel Aviv.\n","Gurion is currently dedicating all her energies to raising awareness about the hostages abducted by Hamason October 7. And she's not alone. Israel's cultural scene is responding to the ongoing hostage situation with art events. \n","In one installation, a long table is decorated with fine dishware; wine glasses and candles set as though for a traditional Shabbat meal. Family members normally gather here ― but the chairs on the square in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art remain empty. They are reserved for the kidnapped hostages. It is a gesture intended to express that the hostages are still very present in the minds of Israelis.\n","Another art project was mounted on Safra Square in Jerusalem: Here, too, it looks as if people should be coming straight back. Some 230 beds are there, pajamas are waiting for their owners, and picture books lie on the bedside tables. \"Empty Beds\" is the name of the installation, which was set up by the organization Bring Them Home Now in collaboration with art students. Together they sang the national anthem, \"Hatikvah,\" whose title means \"hope.\" \n","Israel is a small country. Almost everyone knows someone affected by the massacre in which Hamas terrorists killed 1,400 people in Israel on October 7 or someone whose family members are now being held captive somewhere in the Gaza Strip. \"This Is Us\" is the fitting name of the art project for which the faces of the abducted have been rendered in paint on canvas.\n","\"It's not a place of commemoration; the aim is to get awareness about the hostages,\" says Yifat Gurion. The art project that she helped initiate is a matter close to her heart and one that she wants to take beyond Israel's borders.\n","She feels the hostages are being forgotten, as the current focus is on the humanitarian situation in Gaza: \"I really feel a deep sorrow for the innocent people of Gaza who are suffering,\" Gurion says. \"But it seems that the world is missing the point that this is not retaliation and should not be retaliation. This is an effort to get more than 200 hostages free. So this is a very, very powerful and very important message that must be repeated.\"\n","Artists from all over Israel and some from abroad took part in the project. In front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, they created paintings of the hostages based on photographs.\n","Some 150 artists worked in two shifts, mornings and afternoons. They were highly focused and almost meditative, as though they were connecting psychically with their subjects.\n","One artist painted someone with the same name as theirs; another a person whose birthday it was. Speaking to The Times of Israel, artist Hodaya Gilad said that, the whole time she worked on a portrait of 18-year-old Liri Albab, she wondered what the young girl was going through ― and so felt as if she were getting to know her.\n","It wasn't just the artists who felt that way, but also passersby. There were emotional moments when people recognized friends or family members in the paintings. The square in front of the museum was unofficially renamed The Kidnapped and Missing Square.\n","\"We said the aim is not to have any kind of exhibition,\" says Gurion. \"We don't think it's the right thing to do with portraits of these people. We want to give [them to] the hostages themselves as gifts when they come back.\"\n","\"This Is Us\" is meant to be a sign of hope. Gurion is now storing the paintings at her home and uploading photos of them online.\n","\"Social media are a very powerful tool to spread around and to make the project public in the world,\" she says.\n","Gurion continues to draw hope that the hostages will be released. \"Right now, these times are dark. It's very hard to hang on to hope, it is hard. It's maybe even unnatural,\" she says. \"But we don't have a choice.\"\n","Gurion says she grew up with stories of pioneers who came to Israel from Germany, Russia and other countries. \"Not that they had much choice. Whoever didn't come to Israel was killed in the Holocaust. They came here, and I was born and raised in Israel. This is where I raise my children. These are my friends and family. When I see what happens around the world with the hatred of Jews and of Israel, it gives me the idea that we really have no other place.\"\n","Yifat Gurion does hope there will one day be peace and an end to the cycle of violence.

That's hard to take.\"\n","The now 68-year-old Grau was one of the pioneers of American football in Germany. The founding member of the Ansbach Grizzlies played in the American Football Bundesliga's first season in 1979. He became the German national team's first starting quarterback two years later.\n","Today, he is the only former professional athlete in Germany to speak publicly about the illness he believes he suffers from:  chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.\n","Grau will probably not find out for certain in his lifetime whether he has CTE. To date, the disease can only be definitively diagnosed after death through a brain autopsy. But Grau has been experiencing the symptoms that scientists associate with CTE for over 20 years.\n","His memory is getting fuzzier and fuzzier. He schedules any conversations with people he doesn't know personally before noon as he can hardly concentrate later in the day.\n","\"I also feel dizzy more and more often,\" he said. \"The MRI shows that my brain is atrophying [shrinking] in all areas.\"\n","His physical coordination is deteriorating as well, he said.\n","\"I know it's not going to get any better. But I'm trying to hold on to what I still have,\" he said.\n","At the age of 45, the former secondary school teacher first noticed that he was starting to have trouble concentrating and suddenly becoming quick-tempered and aggressive — something that had never been in his nature.\n","Studies have shown that one's personality can change dramatically during the earliest stage of the disease. The risk of suicide increases and violent outbursts are also possible.\n","Australian rules football player Heather Anderson took her own life in November 2022 at the age of 28. Philipp Adams, a former cornerback in the National Football League (NFL), shot six people and then himself in April 2021. The autopsies on the brains of Anderson and Adams found that both had been suffering from CTE.\n","Around 350 cases of CTE have been confirmed in former NFL players. The disease has also been detected in deceased players in other contact sports such as rugby, ice hockey, football, boxing and martial arts.\n","Their brains were significantly reduced in size. In addition, whole clumps of tau protein were found in the outermost layer of the cerebrum. These tiny protein building blocks stabilize the nerve cells. When the brain makes sudden movements, there is a risk that the proteins will fold incorrectly. This can damage the nerve cell to such an extent that it dies. This can lead to a chain reaction.\n","Like all neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, CTE is currently incurable. Only the symptoms can be treated.\n","In the United States, as well as Australia and New Zealand, countries where Aussie rules football and rugby are particularly popular, \"sports brain banks\" have been established. There, donor brains from deceased athletes are collected and studied.\n","\"It would be a dream come true for me if we also had a sports brain bank specializing in CTE in Germany, to which my brain could be taken after my death,\" Grau said.\n","The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) is currently setting up a brain bank. Researchers here face a shortage of tissue material, as Germans tend to be more reluctant about organ donations than people in many other countries.\n","Researchers were aware of the clinical profile of CTE as early as the 1920s. Back then, it was known as dementia pugilistica (boxer's dementia) or simply being punch drunk. Even back then, it was widely thought that heavy blows to the head could cause lasting damage to the brain. Now we know that even repeated minor blows to the head — blows that aren't sufficient to cause a concussion — can have serious consequences.\n","\"If you accumulate these head concussions over many years, they lead to neurodegenerative processes similar to head trauma,\" Inga Körte, professor of neurobiology at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and Harvard Medical School in Boston told DW.\n","\"This has been established by research over the past 10 years in different sports, age groups and countries. These are robust results.\"\n","But apparently, hardly anyone in Germany is interested.\n","Körte, who has been conducting research on CTE since 2009, visits sports clubs to inform parents about the possible long-term effects of head concussions.\n","\"At one large football [soccer] club, whose name I won't mention, only one interested father turned up,\" Körte said. \"It's obviously not yet an issue that parents in elite-level sports in this country are dealing with.\"\n","Körte's field of research also includes other ailments such as Alzheimer's Disease or depression.\n","\"It's about brain health as a whole. Can the brain tolerate being constantly shaken? The answer is probably no. Or maybe some brains can tolerate it, but not all of them.\"\n","Erich Grau is convinced that \"certainly a quarter\" of his former football teammates are currently experiencing \"extreme mental decline.\" Despite this, they do not talk about the CTE when the guys he played with get together.\n","\"They would rather be the heroes of the past than take these symptoms seriously,\" he said.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","('October 7 massacre: Hapoel Tel Aviv supporters mourn the death of well-known '\n"," 'fan 09.11.2023')\n","We are marching forward\n","To the stadium's gates\n","Carrying a red scarf\n","We're roaring the anthem\n","You'll never walk alone, Hapoel Tel Aviv\n","(Hapoel Tel Aviv's anthem)\n","Tel Aviv is a city that is no stranger to graffiti and street art.

Hermesh, a Kibbutz Kfar Aza native, was among the club's best-known fans.\n","\"Forever red\" is written on a wall dedicated solely to Hermesh. The club's main ultra group, Ultras Hapoel, signed it, citing the club's anthem: \"You'll never walk alone!\"\n","On the morning of October 7, after Hamas had entered Israel's territory, he posted on Facebook that he had been injured as a result of shots fired at his home by the Islamist militant group but that he had survived the attack.\n","\"I'm lucky to be alive,\" he wrote. \"Regarding my injury, worry not. My hand may be full of blood, but it clotted right away.\"\n","This was the last sign of life from Hermesh. On October 18, 11 days after he was listed as missing, his body was identified, causing shock among Hapoel Tel Aviv's supporters across the country.\n","According to Uri Maiselman, who knew Hermesh from his many childhood visits to Kfar Aza, Hermesh was known for giving young supporters a feeling of belonging. One way he did this was to provide them with nicknames. At the funeral, people were asked to write the nickname Hermesh had given them on a piece of cardboard and hold it up for all to see. Some 70 people did so. \n","\"People felt like someone saw them and paid attention to them, that to Omer, they were someone,\" Maiselman told DW.\n","Lucy Joshua, another Hapoel Tel Aviv fan, said that while she didn't know Hermesh personally, it felt like he was a big part of the Hapoel support nonetheless.\n","\"He didn't give me a nickname,\" she told DW, \"but you had the feeling he was always there.\"\n","John is a match-going Hapoel Tel Aviv supporter who is also a member of Israel's Arab minority.

Supporters of other clubs were affected, too.\n","Some 30 of the club's fans were killed on October 7 by Hamas, which the EU, US, Germany, Israel and others consider a terrorist organization. A few more were taken to Gaza as hostages.\n","According to Israeli officials, Hamas killed more than 1,400 people during the attacks, and the militant group seized about 240 hostages.\n","Many Hapoel Tel Aviv fans were among the victims because many of the club's supporters live in a kibbutz, a form of community in which everyone works together, contributing their skills on a voluntary, non-competitive basis.\n","\"Hapoel Tel Aviv is a club established from the workers' movement and traditionally, so were the Kibbutzim,\" long-time Hapoel fan Lucy Joshua explained.\n","Some kibbutzim affected by the October 7 attacks were Nir Oz, Be'eri and Kfar Aza, where Hermesh lived.\n","Our home is Ussishkin\n","We'll never replace it\n","We love you Hapoel\n","The Red Devils!\n","Hapoel Tel Aviv's supporters are known for their diversity, and it's one of two clubs — the other being Maccabi Haifa — that are notable for having a significant number of fans among Arab Israelis. Despite the current war between Israel and Hamas spurring a wave of racism against Israeli citizens of Palestinian descent, the three Hapoel Tel Aviv fans that DW spoke to don't expect the overall tolerant nature of their supporters to change.\n","\"We're strong, and this will only make us stronger,\" said John, also mentioning that many Hapoel fans from the Arab minority joined their Jewish friends from the stands and attended the funerals.\n","\"The love for Hapoel Tel Aviv is all that matters to us, and this will never change,\" he added.\n","\"Hapoel is also Yaffo,\" said Maise lman, thinking ahead to the day after the war is over.

The artist whose trademark is anonymity is also considered the creator of some of the most famous works of street art of all time. Consider the kissing policemen, the anarchist throwing a flower bouquet instead of a Molotov cocktail, or the little girl reaching for a red balloon that's floating away.\n","Spectacular actions like the self-shredding of an artwork right after it sold at auction for a large sum of money have gained Banksy a reputation as a kind of Robin Hood of the art world, a critically-thinking free spirit, a prankster.\n","It's much easier to see a Banksy work on a poster or on the artist's own Instagram account than to glimpse one out in the wild. Street art is, by definition, an ephemeral form of expression.\n","To get a picture of this busy artist's entire oeuvre, you would have to travel almost the entire world. Art experts say Banksy has been active in at least 20 countries over the last two decades — and not just in the artist's hometown of Bristol or in London, but also in hard-to-reach corners of the world, for example in Bethlehem and on the border with the Gaza Strip, where Banksy has been spray-painting since 2015 and has run a hotel near the barrier wall since 2017. Or in the destroyed suburbs of Kyiv, using the ruins of war for powerful expressions of solidarity.\n","But, in some cases, you can stay closer to home and simply go to a Banksy exhibition. As the artist's fame has grown, so have the efforts to place Banksy in a museum context. One exhibition was even authorized by Banksy — titled \"Cut & Run,\" which was held in Glasgow last summer and featured mostly the stencils used to create the iconic street art works. As Banksy described it, \"While the unauthorized Banksy shows may look like the sweepings from the floor of my studio, 'Cut & Run' actually is the sweepings from the floor of my studio.”\n","Following this logic, visitors to the unauthorized show entitled \"The Mystery of Banksy. A Genius Mind\" are not getting to see the actual \"studio sweepings.” But that's done nothing to diminish the popularity of the traveling exhibition, which has been touring Europe since 2021. It's currently being shown simultaneously in Stockholm, Hanover and Cologne, the exhibition's twentieth stop, where it's been on display since November 3.\n","According to the promoter — who usually books music stars like David Garrett on Germany's stages, or organizes newfangled \"immersive exhibitions\" about Tutankhamun or Salvador Dali — more than two million people have already visited the Banksy show. The agency says that in Cologne alone, 15,000 tickets were sold within a short time on the opening weekend.\n","The Cologne exhibition is being housed in an former car dealership, while in Hanover it is on display in a shuttered supermarket, helping to revitalize the city center. According to the curator of the show, Virginia Jean, \"Many visitors travel several hours to see a Banksy exhibition,\" despite the fact that the exhibition does not feature a single Banksy original.\n","\"We deliberately avoid using originals,\" says Jean. \"We don't see our project as a Banksy exhibition, but as a tribute to this artist.\" A team of thirty people, including specialist installers, electricians and six professional graffiti artists, set up the exhibition in the empty space in just ten days — a masterpiece in itself.\n","Visitors get to see quite a bit for their €20 ($21.35) entrance fee: nearly 200 works ranging from street art, sculptures, videos and installations are displayed across some 400 square meters (4,306 sq. feet).\n","Some of Banksy's most spectacular installations are recreated in fifteen rooms, such as \"The Elephant in the Room.\" The animal, decorated with wallpaper patterns, once stood in the middle of a Los Angeles gallery, in a replica 1950-era living room, highlighting poverty and injustice in the world. At the opening, there was a real elephant in the room, as well as a real Angelina Jolie — and maybe even a real Banksy, who knows?\n","The Cologne show has a room that's meant to depict the artist's studio, featuring a hoodie-clad figure sitting at a table. This tableau was probably copied from one of the exhibition rooms of the authorized show in Glasgow. So it's possibly how Banksy's studio actually looks.\n","But what does Banksy himself think of commercial projects like this? Does he not care? Is he outraged and only unable to protest because doing otherwise would risk his anonymity? Or is this kind of fairground Banksy show a new prank by the inventive artist?\n","Fittingly, the organizers want to neither confirm nor deny such speculation. All they will say is that they are in contact with the managers of the \"Banksy\" brand.\n","And they're directing a portion of the profits to the Banksy Foundation, to finance, among other things, the Louise Michel rescue boat. Named after the French anarchist Michel, the 30-meter (98-foot) former yacht and its crew of ten have been rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean since 2020.\n","This article has been adapted from German.\n","The exhibition runs through March 17, 2024.\n","'Picasso painting auctioned off for $139 million 09.11.2023'\n","Pablo Picasso's 1932 painting \"Woman with a Watch\" has been sold for $139.3 million (€129.9 million) at an auction by Sotheby's in New York.\n","It is the second-highest price ever achieved for the painter's work.\n","An anonymous buyer outbid two others to secure the masterpiece on Wednesday.\n","The painting depicts one of the Spanish artist's lovers and muses — French painter Marie-Therese Walter —  seated in a throne-like chair against a blue background.\n","Walter met Picasso in Paris in 1927 at the age of 17, when he was still married to Russian-Ukrainian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova.

He listens to his parents talk. \"It's not safe,\" he hears his mother say. \"We're as good as dead if we stay here.\"\n"," \"We have nowhere to go,\" his father replies. \"What choice do we have?\" \n","They have no choice. The Jewish family is torn apart. First, the father is deported, then the mother and finally the boy.

I can't get over it,\" Luc Bernard told DW. \"I remember those who died. I am not just reducing them to numbers because to me they were kind of our families, friends, neighbors and citizens.\"\n","Raised in France and now based in US, the 37-year-old British Jewish game developer created \"The Light in the Darkness\" almost entirely by himself.\n","It's a project close to his heart that he's been carrying around since 2008. But it took almost 15 years before he could finally release the game.\n","There are so many World War II games, but none about the Holocaust, he said, adding that changing that was his motivation. The rise in antisemitism around the world frightens him, he explained. \"I think it's just going to continue to get worse. Unless we change the way we do Holocaust awareness.\"\n","For a long time, it was taboo to depict the horrors of the Nazi-era in a computer game. Bernard was considered the \"Holocaust guy\" within the games industry. He did not receive any funding or support from NGOs. He put all his own money into the game and still offers it for free.\n","Only now, after the game has been released, is he receiving encouragement — mainly from Europe, but also from the Israeli government. In the first few weeks after its release, some 100,000 people downloaded his game, he says.\n","The more time that passes since the Holocaust, the more difficult it is to create a social awareness of the mass murder of Jews, says Bernard. He wants to use his game to draw young people's attention to the subject in particular, arguing for the importance of reaching them with content instead of hoping they will go to museums or visit memorial sites of their own accord. \n","Bernard's own family history was affected by the Nazis. His British grandmother, whose first husband was a German Jew, cared for Jewish children who were brought to safety from Germany to Britain in 1938 and 1939 on the \"Kindertransport\" (Children's Transport), an organized rescue effort for children.\n","\"In the video game industry, if I'm honest, as a Jewish person in the gaming industry, Jews don't really seem to count much in terms of representation. And our history and trauma doesn't really seem to count much,” says Bernard.\n","Although World War II has for decades been one of the most popular historical settings for video games, especially in the strategy and first-person shooter genres, these stories are usually told from a military point of view. \n","The players are either heroic US Army soldiers saving the world from the Nazis or they command troops and recreate battles. But one central historical aspect almost always remains unmentioned: the Nazi genocide of Europe's Jews.\n","But games influence our cultural memory and color our concept of historical events.\n","It's problematic for the Holocaust to not appear in games, says Christian Huberts of the Foundation for Digital Games Culture, which wants to encourage developers to have greater sensitivity towards this topic. \n","Huberts told DW that, while it may have been unthinkable a decade ago to represent Nazi crimes in video games, there's since been a shift in sensibilities within the games industry.\n","Now games are criticized for completely ignoring the persecution of Jews or for falsely representing history.\n","For example, the first-person shooter \"Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,\" which is set in an alternate reality in which the Nazis won World War II and have occupied the United States, has particularly polarized opinion.\n","It's a long-standing game series that sparked a scandal in the 1990s due to the high levels of violence depicted.\n","There are two versions of the game released in 2017 — a German version and an international one.\n","Due to laws in Germany banning the depiction of unconstitutional symbols such as Nazi swastikas in public — including in video games — all elements of the game that could be illegal in Germany were removed from the German version.\n","\"The result was that Adolf Hitler was called Herr Heiler and didn't have a mustache. And the protagonist's mother was no longer Jewish, but instead was described as a traitor who is arrested and killed,” explains Christian Hubert. \"That means that the German version of the game deliberately disregards the persecution of the Jews.\"\n","These measures sparked a debate that ultimately led to the legal framework in Germany being adjusted. Since then, video games may also show unconstitutional symbols when their depiction serves \"to promote the arts or science, research or teaching, reporting about current or historical events, or similar purposes.”\n","Studies by the Jewish Claims Conference, which works to provide compensation and support for victims of Nazism, have found that many people in the US, France, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria are unaware of the Holocaust. Especially among Millennials and Generation Z, many are convinced that the number of Jews killed has been exaggerated. Some even believe the Holocaust never happened.\n","At the same time, games are the main entertainment medium for more than half of all Millennials. So why not link Holocaust remembrance with games?\n","Video games are a good way to learn, confirms Huberts. They can make it possible to directly experience not only historical spaces and landscapes, but also how political systems work.\n","For example, if players are given fewer and fewer opportunities to intervene in a plot, they could experience \"how a fascist political system can spread its power, how rights suddenly disappear,\" Huberts explained.\n","But most players tend to ignore educational or \"serious” games.\n","That's why Berlin-based studio Paintbucket Games is taking a different approach. Founders Jörg Friedrich and Sebastian Schulz want to make games that distinguish themselves from common themes.\n","They're behind the 2020 strategy game, \"Through the Darkest of Times,\" in which players lead a resistance group of civilians fighting against the Nazi regime between 1933 to 1945.\n","And in the studio's detective game \"The Darkest Files,\" released in 2023, players slip into the role of a fictional prosecutor uncovering real Nazi crimes. The boss is Fritz Bauer (1903-1968), who played an essential role in launching the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials.\n","\"We're not trying to produce software that's admonishing, moralizing, instructional,\" Friedrich told DW. \"We want to create an interesting, exciting, engaging game that gives a topic long neglected in games the attention it's due.\"\n","Video games shouldn't replace books, exhibitions and documentaries about the Holocaust.\n","But they can be a good supplement and have the potential to reach people who otherwise pay little attention to the persecution and extermination of Jews under Nazism, according to games developer Luc Bernard. \n","\"There just need to be more games about that period,\" he said. \"Not just war games.\" \n","This article was adapted from the German original.\n","'Why is North Korea shutting some embassies in Africa? 06.11.2023'\n","In late October, North Korea's ambassadors to Angola and Uganda both said their farewells to local leaders, with South Korean media speculating that more North Korean embassies across Africa may be forced to close in the coming months because of Pyongyang's financial difficulties.\n","\"It is clear that they are having financial problems and their international position is becoming increasingly isolated, but it may also be that Pyongyang does not really have a direct interest in some of these countries anymore,\" said Lim Eun-jung, an associate professor of international studies at Kongju National University in South Korea.\n","\"Despite the sanctions, the North is not completely broke, and it is likely that they want to focus their financial resources on their nuclear and long-range missile capabilities, as well as the surveillance satellite that they have promised to launch in the near future,\" she told DW.\n","Lim added that North Korea is not receiving as warm a welcome in many African nations as it used to.\n","Angola, for example, accepted around 3,000 military \"advisers\" in the 1970s and 1980s.

Since then, the United States have hosted the Games on four more occasions (San Francisco in 1986, New York in 1994, Chicago in 2006 and Cleveland/Akron in 2014).\n","They first went abroad to Vancouver in 1990, and left North America for the first time in 1998 when they were hosted by Amsterdam. Other European cities to have hosted the Gay Games are Cologne (2010) and Paris (2018), while Sydney hosted the 2002 Games. The 2026 Games will take place in Valencia, Spain.\n","The current 11th edition of the Gay Games was originally scheduled for November 2022 in Hong Kong, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are now taking place from November 3-11 with Guadalajara, the second-biggest city in Mexico, added as a co-host.\n","It is the first time that the Gay Games will be held in Asia and Latin America, and indeed across two continents.\n","Sports events at the Gay Games are divided into seven general categories: ball games, racquet sports, sea sports, running, mat sports, swimming and table sports.\n","Within these categories are subcategories including specific sports such as fencing and martial arts, tennis, table tennis, badminton and squash.\n","Sixteen sports will take place in Hong Kong, while 21 will take place in Guadalajara. Many will take place in both locations.\n","\"This is a huge chance for us,\" said Mexican transgender footballer Noemi Arzate, speaking to DW from her home in Mexico City. \"Firstly, to test ourselves in international competition, and secondly to discover other cultures, meet new people and make new friends.\"\n","Arzate said she never imagined such an international competition taking place since \"so many things were blocked\" for her in the past.\n","\"Imagine what it means to have such a huge event as the Gay Games to make us visible,\" she said. \"It's a great thing to make trans women more visible in sport and take part in this competition.\"\n","The influence of China on Hong Kong has led to restrictions on the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the financial enclave on the South China Sea in recent years.\n","Same-sex relationships are legal, and a recent judgement from the Supreme Court did guarantee certain rights for same-sex couples.\n","However, same-sex marriage is not permitted with equal rights and there are no specific anti-discrimination laws for the protection of the LGBTQ+ community in Hong Kong, where there have been massive protests against the government in recent years.\n","The awarding of the Games to Hong Kong has therefore drawn criticism, but organizers say they hope the Games and their message of inclusivity can help improve the situation both in Hong Kong and across Asia generally.\n","\"We believe that hosting the Games for the very first time here will be a momentous experience and a cornerstone for our Asian community as well as for the whole world.

So, of course, the city's Bach Festival in 2023 was a giant anniversary celebration.\n","Bach was the not the first choice of the Leipzig City Counsellors to become Thomaskantor. They would have preferred the very experienced and very famous Georg Philipp Telemann, but they couldn't tempt him away from Hamburg, where he was getting a better salary for a comparable position. Another composer, Christoph Graupner, was also on the shortlist, but he was still in the services of a count, and it would have cost too much to release him from the contract. It was only half a year later that the Leipzig Counsellors thought of Johann Sebastian Bach, the talented Kapellmeister from the nearby city of Köthen.\n","The big day finally arrived on May 30, 1723: Bach conducted the early mass in Leipzig's St. Nicholas Church for the parish community. He had composed the cantata \"Die Elenden sollen essen,\" \"The poor shall eat,\" for his debut, and it remains one his most popular cantatas to this day.\n","The work consists of two parts and was written so that the sermon could be interspersed among the music. This may be the reason that the total length, around 35 minutes, didn't raise any eyebrows. You see, there was clause in Bach's contract that said his music should be neither too long nor too operatic, and that it should move people to solemn reflection.\n","The subject of the Bach cantata \"Die Elenden sollen essen,\" or \"The poor shall eat\" is the moment in the Gospel of St Luke when Lazarus is compared to the rich man. The story is a call to help the poor in order to secure a place in heaven and to practice Christian brotherly love.\n","Andreas Reize, who is, by the way, the 18th person to hold the Thomaskantor position after Bach, tells us more: \"Bach made his debut with a bang with 'Die Elenden sollen essen.' You really get the sense that he wanted to make his ambitions clear, coming from his position as Kapellmeister from Köthen. There are lots of dance-like movements, an overture at the start, which then flows into this 'lamento' – extremely impressive.\"\n","Bach festival director Michael Maul sees the seeds of Bach's later works in this cantata: \"In modern terms, I would call it a kind of trailer for a large musical series, where – just as in a good movie trailer – you get glimpses of all the unique moments that will then be shown more fully in the film.\"\n","Both the St. Thomas Choir, a boys choir, and the Gewandhaus Orchestra, have deep historic roots in Leipzig. The Gewandhaus Orchestra is the oldest civic (as in, non-royal) symphony orchestra in the world. It was founded in 1743 by 16 nobles and non-nobles and was initially a sort of private concert enterprise. Today, in addition to packed concert seasons, the renowned orchestra also performs Bach cantatas on a weekly basis in St. Thomas Church. They're joined there by the St. Thomas Choir, which is also internationally famous thanks in part to extensive touring. The choir has been around for 800 years, but it's only since Bach that the Thomaskantor, or music director of the choir, has been numbered. He was literally number one.\n","2023 was the 300th anniversary of Bach becoming the Thomaskantor. To celebrate, the city of Leipzig's annual Bach Festival took place under the motto \"Bach for Future.\" They wanted to highlight how Bach remains relevant today and continues to inspire new ideas in contemporary composers.\n","It was along those lines that the Bach Festival commissioned clarinetist, conductor and composer Jörg Widmann to compose a cantata that reflects the present-day.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Widmann sees his cantata as a journey. It starts by doubting the existence of God and ends by singing of peace and praising God with hallelujahs. This final text is by Paul Gerhard, a poet whose texts Bach also set to music.\n","Widmann used the traditional cantata form, featuring solos and chorales, but he made it his own by including texts from different sources and by different authors. War and peace were the themes of the work, but Widmann wasn't thinking only of the war in Ukraine when he composed the cantata. Rather, he was thinking of war in general and throughout all time. He explains:  \"In this commission I got from the Bachfest, it was not possible to simply say, 'Oh yes, let's praise God and let's praise Bach and then let's go home.' You know, it's not enough. I think it's really necessary to address these things. Therefore my piece ends with a very short but urgent call for peace. You know, call me naive, yes, probably rightly so. And by the way, naivety in a well understood sense is a kind of precondition to make music, to make arts. So nothing against naivety, in a well-understood sense.\n","Those deep thoughts from composer Jörg Widmann close out this Deutsche Welle Festival Concert.\n","Performances in this recording:\n","All music recorded by the Bach Festival and Deutsche Welle (DW) at the St Thomas Church, Leipzig, on June 10 and 11, 2023\n","1.

To sign with McLaren and ART Grand Prix is way beyond anything I could've ever imagined growing up racing karts in the Philippines,\" Bustamante said in a statement on McLaren's website.\n","\"I still have a hard time seeing my name next to McLaren without getting emotional, as the history and heritage linked to this team leaves me truly speechless.\"\n","In May 2023, Bustamante won her first race in the F1 Academy, winning the second of three races in Valencia.\n","\"When I won, it was like the whole world suddenly exploded,\" Bustamante told DW in June.\n","The 18-year-old received a message from the president of the Philippines, had a resolution voiced on the country's senate floor and saw her face splashed across an enormous billboard on the busiest street in Manila.\n","\"I honestly didn't know how to react. I wasn't expecting the effect would be this much. It was really a crazy moment for me. To experience all this stuff at 18, sometimes I think it's a bit too much,\" she said.\n","It would be easy to dismiss this response as classic athlete hyperbole, but Bustamante's journey to this point explains why the tears flowed, and the country celebrated when the teenager stood on the podium.\n","Her father, a motorsport fanatic, bought Bustamante her first suit when she was just 1. She was in a baby race cart by age three, and at just six years old, Bustamante knew a life in motorsport was what she wanted.\n","\"Financially, it definitely wasn't easy for us. You know, coming from the Philippines, we're a very middle-class family. My dad is actually an overseas worker. He moved away when I was young just so he could support the family and put food on the table,\" she said.\n","\"The fact that I was racing, it was really, really difficult for the whole family. We made a lot of sacrifices, sometimes you might say too many. That's why I've always felt like I've had to pay them back.\"\n","Many aiming to be in professional sports say failure isn't an option, and yet, for one of myriad reasons that make being a professional athlete so hard, never make it. Like them, Bustamante never had a prom or sleepovers and has been home-schooled for most of her life. A lot of what makes a typical childhood has been missing.\n","\"Five, seven years ago, we were just struggling to even pay for the entry fee, fuel, tires. It made for a difficult road, and because of that, I needed to really value every time I was just able to drive, to race because I never really knew when it would be the last time.\"\n","Life hasn't been easy for Bustamante, but one mantra has helped her through: \"When life's tough, you've got to be tougher.\"\n","That approach has helped her go from karting glory as a child to the top rookie in the W Series [an all-female single-seater championship] last year. In 2023, she is set to finish in the top 7 of the 2023 F1 Academy racing for Prema Racing — the starting point for many F1 talents such as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.\n","To be here is a testament to Bustamante's determination, but even now, on the biggest stage, home remains a long way away. \"Other drivers have a home to go to after the race, but for me, home is a bit too far, so I'm often by myself,\" she told DW.\n","\"There's a lot of moments where you kind of have a crash. You have so much adrenaline during a race weekend, and then suddenly, you're back to being by yourself. It's one of the struggles.\"\n","It's a poignant reminder of the mental fortitude needed when competing at the highest level. Family support helps, perhaps none more so than the bond she shares with her brother.\n","\"I have a brother, and he has autism and Down syndrome. I think having him really taught me how to not only think of myself but to be very selfless with a lot of things because, with him, I've always had to be selfless with moments where I needed to be very patient, forgiving when he would throw tantrums,\" Bustamante said, adding that after her win in Valencia, her brother was one of the first people she called.\n","\"And I think that's why I've always been really, really patient with life, dealing with difficulties, losing, progress, patience just with everything. With that comes a lot of maturity. To not act on your emotions, or what's around you or in the moment, it really takes a lot of self-control and discipline.\"\n","It's no surprise that her end goal is to join the biggest show in motorsport.\n","\"The end goal for me is making it to Formula One. That's my Everest,\" Bustamante told DW. \"Everything I'm doing is to hopefully make it there.\"\n","Last year at Hungaroring, Bustamante got a taste of the big show when she met seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton. The two bonded over the similarities of their journeys, two aspiring drivers who didn't look like anyone on the grid. For the teenager, the meeting was \"a moment she'll always cherish,\" and she credits Hamilton as one of the original supporters of the existence of the F1 Academy.\n","\"Lewis has always supported women in motorsport. He was one of the first few people who really stood up for it and said: 'We need to have an initiative to support women.' Looking back five years ago, there wasn't even an initiative for women in the sport,\" she said.\n","\"The fact that now, it's not just about us drivers, but even engineers like McLaren launching their new women program for STEM engineers — that's amazing,\" Bustamante said, referring to the science, technology, engineering and math courses that lay the foundation for a career in motorsport. The teenager has herself specialized in STEM and was, as of early June, on the verge of graduating.\n","By securing a deal with McLaren, Bustamante has not just taken a huge step towards realizing her goal of being on the F1 grid at some point in the future, but she's also paved the way for women in motorsports and in the Philippines. Bustamante is just getting started, and the teenager has a lot more to do, including hopefully making more phone calls to her brother after a race win.\n","Edited by: James Thorogood\n","\"'20 Days in Mariupol' director: Fight in Ukraine goes on 17.10.2023\"\n","A pregnant woman is carried away on a stretcher after a Russian missile strike on a maternity hospital: This shocking image from the Siege of Mariupol traveled around the world.\n","The reason it exists in the first place is thanks to the Ukrainian war correspondents working for the Associated Press, who remained in the city when it was encircled and extensively bombed by Russian troops.\n","They were the last team of international journalists on site, covering the first 20 days of the siege that left the city in ruins.\n","The Ukrainian reporters Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their work, as well as many other awards — including the Deutsche Well Freedom of Speech Award.\n","Mstyslav Chernov then turned his video footage into a film, titled \"20 days in Mariupol.\"\n","The documentary has been selected as Ukraine's submission to the 2024 Oscars in the best international feature category.\n","The film, which has also won the World Cinema documentary prize following its Sundance premiere, celebrated its German premiere at Berlin's Human Rights Film Festival, where DW met the filmmaker.\n","The documentary goes way beyond the news stories using the Associated Press material that was widely broadcast around the world.\n","\"That was one of the main reasons why this film needed to be made,\" says Chernov. \"The impressions you get from one-minute to two-minute news pieces is very different to what you feel and what you understand when you watch 95 minutes,\" which, he says, is still \"not enough to speak about all the tragedies that happened in Mariupol — even the 30 hours [of video footage] that I managed to get out from the city is not enough.\"\n","The estimated number of Ukrainians killed in besieged Mariupol varies greatly; the film cites the Ukrainian count of more than 25,000 deaths.\n","According to UN estimates, 90% of the city's apartment buildings and 60% of single-family homes were damaged.\n","Meanwhile, Russia is knocking down those destroyed buildings, and is building new ones \"just to make good pictures,\" says Chernov, thereby erasing the locations that could help determine the scale of the war crimes committed by Russia. \"There is less and less evidence left with every every single day that passes by.\"\n","\"20 Day in Mariupol\" portrays not only from the inside how a modern European city was bombed to ruins, how children fell victim to the missiles and how mass graves had to be created to bury thousands of bodies, but also provides a reminder of how Russia framed the events.\n","At the beginning of the film, Vladimir Putin is shown stating in a televised speech at the launch of the invasion that his \"special military operation\" is absolutely necessary, because otherwise Russia would be attacked first. As one Mariupol resident puts it sarcastically in the film, the Russian leader was \"beautifully, so beautifully\" deceptive in his speech.\n","This reminder that the whole conflict is based on Putin's lies makes the images of its bloody impact even more painful to watch.\n","As the medical team in the hospital where the Associated Press journalists were based desperately tried to revive a toddler badly wounded by Russian shells, or operate a teenager whose legs were blown off while playing soccer, the head surgeon encourages Chernov to film every gory detail: \"Show that Putin bastard the eyes of this child!\" he yells. \"Show what these motherf**kers are doing to civilians!\"\n","As Chernov states in the film's narration: \"This is painful to watch but it must be painful to watch.\"\n","The Ukrainian reporters managed to send their reports to Western media at the risk of their lives, as they often had to reach uncovered spots where WiFi might still be available.\n","But Russia was quick to label the images as \"fake news.\"\n","As they were released, the Russian Embassy in London tweeted that that the pregnant woman shown in the AP photos was an actress. The documentary also shows a clip of a British journalist confronting the Kremlin's ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, with Chernov's footage; the diplomat brushes off the question about the killing of babies as \"information wars.\"\n","\"It's impossible to tell the story of Mariupol completely without telling how much misinformation and misinterpretation is connected to it,\" Chernov tells DW. As we discuss the topic of war reporting, the filmmaker however stresses that his film is not about journalists: \"It's the story of my people, who were trapped, killed, lost their homes,\" says the director who was born in Kharkiv, another border city that was hard hit by the Russians.\n","Nevertheless, \"20 Days in Mariupol\" also chronicles a modern-age phenomenon that is harming the work of journalists globally, as fake news is contaminating the coverage of all contested issues — as is currently the case in the war between terrorist group Hamas and Israel.\n","Asked if he's worried that the world will start forgetting the Ukrainians as the Middle East flares up, the war reporter realistically points out: \"The shifting of the media's attention was inevitable. We work in the news. We know that attention shifts and comes back later.\" Chernov is also well aware that both conflicts are geopolitically connected.\n","But, he adds, some parts of European society are mistaken in their belief that if only weapons were no longer delivered to Ukraine, war would stop and peace negotiations would happen: \"I don't think that a shift in international support for Ukraine will stop the fight. Ukrainians are fighting for their survival. So it just means that more Ukrainians will die, because nobody will watch, nobody will help.\"\n","The 2023 Human Rights Film Festival Berlin is held from October 11-22.\n","The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce the films on the 2024 Oscar shortlist on December 21, and its final five nominees on January 23, 2024.\n","Edited by: Brenda Haas\n","\n"," \n","('After Hamas attacks, cultural scene remained widely silent on Israel '\n"," '16.10.2023')\n","Immediately after the large-scale terrorist attacks on Israel by the militant Islamist Hamas, numerous Hollywood stars and other cultural figures in the US expressed their solidarity with the country under the hashtag #standwithisrael.\n","On October 12, 700 Hollywood stars, including actors Gal Gadot, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Douglas and Chris Pine, as well as comedians Jerry Seinfeld and Amy Schumer, signed an open letter created by the non-profit organization Creative Community for Peace.\n","The Hollywood stars condemned the Hamas assault as \"barbaric acts of terrorism\" and called on Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by the US, Germany, the EU and others, to release its Israeli hostages.\n","They also warned their entertainment industry colleagues against misinformation on social media, saying, \"As Israel takes the necessary steps to defend its citizens in the coming days and weeks, social media will be overrun by an orchestrated misinformation campaign spearheaded by Iran. We urge everyone to remember the horrific images that came out of Israel and to not amplify or fall for their propaganda.\"\n","In several German cities, including Berlin, Munich and Rostock, many have demonstrated their solidarity with Israel at rallies in recent days.\n","But Germany's cultural institutions remained reticent. For example, it was not until October 11, four days after the attacks, that the German Cultural Council issued a statement that said it \"resolutely opposes any form of antisemitism\" and called on cultural institutions in Germany to clearly show their solidarity with Israel.\n","\n","From this call it is perhaps possible to see what journalist and author Simon Strauss denounced in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: \"Where are the Israeli flags? Where are the banners, the posters, the placards?\"\n","Comparing the situation with the prompt declarations of solidarity with Ukraine following Russia's invasion, Strauss made it very clear in his article what he actually expects from Germany: More solidarity with Israel. After all, Israel's security and right to exist is Germany's reason of state, after Germany's systematic murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust. This reason of state is supported by the current government's coalition agreement, and has been reaffirmed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a government statement on October 12, 2023.\n","In his October 11 Spiegel Online column titled \"Why are you still silent?\", author Sascha Lobo elaborated the manifold reasons for the stubborn silence of many people who otherwise regularly speak out about grievances on social media.\n","He concludes by saying, \"Those who live in Germany today are not to blame for the Holocaust. But all those living here bear the responsibility to learn from it. And that can in no way mean remaining silent about antisemitic terrorism.\"\n","The silence does not seem to be just a German problem. On the Artnet news site, which focuses on the international art trade, Jewish editor Katya Kazakina wrote of a \"deafening silence\" in the art world — especially from renowned and long-established galleries and museums, which in the past frequently spoke out when it came to defending human rights, as in the case of the Ukraine war, Black Lives Matter or LGBTQ rights.\n","\"In New York, the home of the largest Jewish population outside of Israel, not a single major museum has so far expressed its official support for the Jewish state and, by extension, the Jewish people,\" Kazakina wrote on October 12.\n","\"Not one major gallery chose to send a message of empathy and take a public stand against the slaughter of Jewish civilians.\" She added, \"As a Jewish woman, who's been writing about art, artists, galleries, museums, auction houses, foundations, fairs, and lawsuits for more than 17 years, I feel a mixture of pain, disappointment, rage, and fear. (...) Where is the solidarity? Where is the empathy? Where is the moral compass?\"\n","In their articles, Strauss, Lobo and Kazakina look for reasons why so little solidarity with Israel has been shown so far. Is it the fear of being seen as a \"colonialist\" in view of the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population in the Gaza Strip? Or is it ultimately antisemitic tendencies that have led to this \"deafening silence\"?\n","Perhaps it is also the fear of Islamist terrorism. For example, the organizer of the solidarity demonstration for Israel in Munich has received death threats.\n","There may be many reasons for this silence, but the result remains the same: People of Jewish faith, already deeply shocked by the current events in Israel, are now further unsettled by this.\n","\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'100 years of Disney: Catapulting cartoons to global fame 16.10.2023'\n","\"Just remember, it all started with a mouse,\" Walt Disney declared in a TV program in 1954.\n","At that time, his film production company had already been in business for more than 30 years and was one of the most successful in the US — with cartoons!\n","Mickey Mouse had not only become a screen hero, but was already smiling on T-shirts, footballs and toothbrush cups. One year later, in 1955, the cartoon mouse even came to life at the first Disneyland to open in California.\n","Walt Disney, who was born in 1901 and grew up on a farm in Missouri, started out as a commercial artist and then discovered animated films. With just $40 in his pocket, he set off for Hollywood and, on October 16, 1923, founded the Walt Disney Company, today a billion-dollar enterprise.\n","\"It's kind of fun to do the impossible,\" was one of the cartoon pioneer's convictions.\n","Hidden behind this carefree statement was an intense, almost manic work ethic and workload, but also an unwavering belief in his own ideas. Time and again, the farm boy was on the verge of bankruptcy. His projects were considered too daring; with the latest film technology always being tested and and perfected. Driven, Walt Disney was soon sleeping on a couch in his studios, hardly seeing his own children, yet working hard in order to enchant other, unfamiliar children with his on-screen fairy tales.\n","Walt Disney made film history in 1937: \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was the first full-length animated film to hit theaters — Mickey Mouse and Co. had previously only starred in short films. At the time, no one could have guessed that an additional 60 feature-length films would follow to this day.\n","After all, the daring producer Walt Disney had made a dramatic miscalculation: Instead of $250,000 (approx. €228,000), $1.5 million were required to complete the film; instead of 18 months, his cartoonists worked for three years on an idea that was considered complete lunacy in Hollywood. A feature-length animated film? Who's going to line up at the box office for that?\n","As became apparent after the film's release, it turned out that quite a few people would: \"Snow White\" grossed around $8 million — at a time when a movie ticket cost an average of 25 US cents.\n","Translated into 10 languages, the film went on to be a box office smash in 46 more countries.\n","Disney received an honorary Oscar at the following year's Academy Awards — or more precisely, and true to the film's title, eight: one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes.\n","Working at Walt Disney Studios, on the other hand, was allegedly not always a fairy tale.\n","Requirements to work overtime, poor wages and a boss who micro-managed every stroke of the pen: those were the working conditions at the company, along with a boss whose creative ego demanded one name be shown in the opening credits — that of he himself, Walt Disney.\n","Even today, his signature adorns the logo of the billion-dollar corporation.\n","Yet it wasn't Walt Disney's talent alone that led to the success of the company.  He founded the studios together with his brother Roy, who later took over the finances.\n","The mouse that started it all was designed by art director Ub Iwerks, but apparently according to the strict specifications of the character's inventor.\n","\n","Incidentally, Mickey Mouse was also created during an entrepreneurial low point: during a train journey back to Los Angeles. In New York, Walt Disney had been unable to reach an agreement with a distributor, who snatched his then successful short cartoons, \"Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,\" from right under his nose.\n","Walt Disney was both a visionary and a businessman. And he had a knack for discovering talented people.\n","Oddly, it was during the Great Depression at the end of the 1920s, when companies went bankrupt and many families became desperately poor, that merchandising was born.\n","With the ingenious advertising manager Kay Kamen on board, Mickey Mouse's likeness was emblazoned on socks, cereal boxes and footballs from the 1930s onward. Disney Studios soon earned considerably more from their advertising products than from the films themselves.\n","They are still a central source of income for the company, worth billions of dollars today.\n","\n","Following \"Snow White,\" \"Pinocchio\" (1940), \"Dumbo\" (1941) and \"Bambi\" (1942) were among the films Disney Studios released. But the films were unable to match the success of \"Snow White\": The anticipated revenues failed to materialize, partly because the European sales market collapsed due to the Second World War.\n","Since hardly any banks could be found to provide the necessary loans for new productions, the company went public.\n","Today, according to the Institute for Media and Communications Policy, the Walt Disney Company ranks sixth among the world's most successful media groups and is part of the Dow Jones stock index, which lists the 30 most successful US companies.\n","During World War II, Disney Studios became an instrument of US propaganda. The studios produced numerous short films and cartoons that glorified US warfare and reproduced stereotypical images of the enemy.\n","For example, in the well-known propaganda film \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (1943), Donald Duck is forced to work in an armaments factory in Nazi Germany and goes crazy hearing shouts of \"Heil Hitler.\"\n","Likewise, Disney produced educational and training films for the US Army. Critics complained that the company would have been better off spreading pacifist and humanist messages instead of war propaganda.\n","In the post-World War II years, Disney built on the success of his feature-length films — with \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1951) and \"Peter Pan\" (1953).\n","In 1955, Walt Disney had another crazy idea: his fairy tale worlds were to become reality, and so the first Disneyland was built in the US state of California. Later, offshoots followed in Florida, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n","Walt Disney was awarded 26 Oscars during his lifetime — an unprecedented record. However, he did not live to see the premiere of his last film, \"The Jungle Book\" (1967), as he died of lung cancer in 1966.\n","Still, the Disney brand lived on, despite a massive financial crisis during the early 1980s. In 1986, Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney took over management of the animation studio and, together with Jeffrey Katzenberg, led a \"Disney renaissance\": \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989), \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991) and \"The Lion King\" (1994) were born.\n","\"I think when you relate Disney to anything, you relate it to magic, and imagination and creativity, and I think that's what's so different about our company: It's that we tell stories and we make magic in everything that we do,\" Betty Cline, director of the Walt Disney Archive, told DW.\n","From the 2000s onward, the former cartoon company set its sights on expansion. First, it bought the successful animation studio Pixar (with whom it had already produced films such as \"Toy Story\" and \"Finding Nemo\"), then swallowed the numerous superhero films with Marvel, and finally, the long-running box office hit company Lucasfilm with the \"Star Wars\" series. TV series and several prequels, sequels and spin-offs followed.\n","Of course, in the spirit of its founder, Disney continues to keep pace with technological innovations. Although its own streaming platform Disney+ started somewhat late in 2019 and stumbled at first, its quarterly figures for 2022 now position it in third place worldwide behind Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n","While the billion-dollar corporation may be able to safely overcome financial hurdles, its former core business — fairy-tale films — has come under fire. Following allegations of racist depictions in classics such as \"Dumbo\" or \"The Jungle Book,\" Disney began adding warning labels to its films.\n","In response to criticism of cultural appropriation, such as in the marketing of the Swahili saying \"Hakuna Matata\" (loosely: \"No worries\") from the 1994 film \"The Lion King,\" the corporation is also now trying to deal more sensitively with the cultural attributes of other nations and peoples. So on the occasion of the 100th anniversary, it launched the long-awaited live-action film version of \"The Little Mermaid\" — with leading Black actress Halle Bailey.\n","The \"Disney 100\" international exhibition tour is currently on show in London, and opens in Chicago on November 18.\n","This article was originally written in German and first published on April 18, 2023.

Bianco concludes they \"don't have the leverage they used to have,\" which could in turn impact their influence at the negotiating table. \n","She also regards the relevance of Qatar's Al Jazeera as more limited compared to the past. \"It still is a powerful instrument but not as powerful as it used to be before social media,\" she told DW.\n","Fitting perhaps that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani's sister has taken to social media. \n","While international landmarks, such as the White House in Washington, Berlin's Brandenburger Gate or the Sydney Opera House, were lit in solidarity with the colors of the Israeli flag, it was the Palestinian flag that was projected on the National Museum of Qatar and the Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar's capital Doha.\n","Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani shared photos of the light installations with her 1 million Instagram followers, writing in Arabic, \"Oh Allah, we entrust Palestine and its people to you.\"\n","Edited by: Jon Shelton\n","\"Will Egypt's presidential election bring any real change? 04.10.2023\"\n","It didn't take long for Egypt to jump into election mode.

Kaldas, deputy director of the Washington-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told DW.\n","Indeed, the two most promising opposition candidates, Ahmed Altantawy, the former head of the leftist al-Karama (Dignity) Party, and Gameela Ismail, the chairwoman of the liberal al-Dostour (Constitution) Party, reported that their supporters were being harassed, interrogated and, in Altantawy's case, also detained.\n","The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), a Cairo-based think tank, confirmed that the crackdown on Altantawy's supporters \"has intensified, with at least 73 campaign members detained in connection to charges of joining a subversive or terrorist group, spreading false news, and misusing social media.\"\n","\"They were interrogated simply for filling out volunteer forms in Altantawy's presidential campaign, while others just liked the campaign's Facebook page,\" the think tank added.\n","Egypt's National Election Authority, which oversees the country's electoral process, responded in a statement that these claims \"are baseless and false allegations.\"\n","Meanwhile, Mada Masr, Egypt's last non-state-controlled news site, reported that the phone of Altantawy was hacked multiple times in the past months.\n","\"There is very little reason to believe that this election will look any different to that of 2018,\" Alice Gower, Director of Geopolitics and Security at the London-based consultancy firm Azure Strategy, told DW.\n","In the 2018 election, el-Sissi won with 97% against one allied opponent after four opposition candidates were arrested or decided to quit due to threats and intimidation. \n","El-Sissi has been in power since 2013 after leading a military coup that toppled Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, democratically elected after the Arab Spring uprising in 2011. Two elections have occurred since, in 2014 and 2018, but observers criticize that both lacked fairness.\n","In 2019, el-Sissi consolidated his power after amending the constitution, allowing the incumbent to stand for a third term. The changes also adjusted the length of presidential terms from four to six years, which would see el-Sissi in power until 2030 should he win.\n","Despite el-Sissi calling on \"Egyptians to witness this democratic scene, and to choose the right person for the role,\" at a congress last weekend, Kaldas regards the upcoming vote as \"electoral theater.\"\n","\"If there was a competitive election, el-Sissi would be extremely vulnerable,\" he said. \"Public discontent with the leadership, the deterioration in the economy, and the standard of living of most Egyptians has deteriorated for the duration of el-Sissi's tenure.\"\n","Egypt has been mired in an economic crisis for years, and Russia's war in Ukraine has exacerbated the financial situation of the wheat-importing country — food prices have soared nearly 72% over the past year.\n","According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Egypt's GDP growth is predicted to be just 3.7% in 2023, after 6.7% growth in 2022. The country is also grappling with record inflation of 39%, and a loss of 50% of the Egyptian pound's value against the US dollar since February 2022, according to Egypt's Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics. \n","Egypt signed a $3 billion (€2.85 billion) agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 2022. However, it has only received $347 million of the loan because the nation has yet to make the required budgetary cuts and reforms. Meanwhile, the country's foreign currency reserves are almost depleted. In light of these figures, a few comments in el-Sissi's campaign speech last weekend caused irritation.\n","\"If the price of the nation's progress and prosperity is hunger and thirst, let us not eat or drink,\" he said.\n","In response, Altantawy posted on X, formerly Twitter, that \"Egyptians actually starved during your rule because of your administration.\"\n","Egypt's international partners have also started voicing more criticism and demands. For example, Gulf countries, who have long unconditionally supported Egypt financially, \"have made quite clear, both publicly and privately, that they're dissatisfied with the way the country is being run,\" Kaldas told DW.\n","Egypt, however, is not only scrutinized economically but also over its poor human rights record. Human rights organizations have long estimated that 65,000 to 70,000 political prisoners are held in pretrial detention or after unjust trials in Egypt's prisons. In the run-up to the presidential election, this crackdown has intensified once more.\n","Earlier this week, the human rights organization Redress, and several Egyptian non-governmental organizations concluded in a legal analysis that the use of torture by Egyptian authorities was so widespread and systematic that it amounted to a crime against humanity under customary international law. The NGOs submitted the report to the United Nations Committee Against Torture ahead of its review of Egypt's record in November. \n","\"Political opponents are silenced by jailing them, civil society organizations are limited by making obligatory licensing very difficult, and organizing [protest] has become very difficult, as the political space has pretty much eroded in the last 10 years,\" Lina Attalah, editor-in-chief of Mada Masr, told DW.\n","That's what makes the protests across the country earlier this week all the more remarkable. Several state-sponsored rallies celebrating el-Sissi's candidacy announcement turned into anti-government demonstrations, but were quickly dismissed as art gatherings by the authorities, according to the German news agency dpa.\n","Numerous videos on social media, verified as accurate by Egyptian activists, showed people shouting: \"The people call for the fall of the regime.\"\n","Edited by: Davis VanOpdorp\n","\n","\"'Assassin's Creed Mirage': Why time traveling never gets old 04.10.2023\"\n","The \"Assassin's Creed\" game series has been sending gamers back in time since 2007.\n","In the first title of the series, players traveled back to the 12th century and explored Jerusalem. In other games, they sailed through the Caribbean on impressive ships; experienced the social upheaval in Paris caused by the French Revolution; explored pyramids in ancient Egypt; fought against the Athenians and Spartans in Ancient Greece; and finally slipped into the role of a Viking — with the option of selecting a female Viking — to conquer England.\n","Even though the locations and epochs depicted in the game series are exotic, they were generally chosen for their popularity among the fan base.\n","The setting of the new game, \"Assassin's Creed Mirage,\" is perhaps not as present in current pop culture: The action takes place in Baghdad in the 9th century.\n","Today's capital of Iraq, which its residents then also called Madinat-al-Salam, the City of Peace, was a thriving metropolis under the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate. It was the center of powerful secular and religious rulers, contemporary artists, traders, philosophers and scientists.\n","At the time, at least 500,000 people of various religious faiths lived in the city by the Tigris River.\n","When recreating historical settings for the games, the \"Assassin's Creed\" developers have always aimed to achieve a high level of authenticity.\n","Players are led to discover particular historical locations in the game world, and also get to learn about how people lived during that period and meet important historical figures.\n","In \"Assassin's Creed Mirage,\" for example, they meet scholar Ali ibn Muhammad, an opponent of the ruling Abbasids, or the Banu Musa brothers, three gifted scientists and inventors.\n","The games are not 100% historically accurate — but they don't have to be, says historian Lucas Haasis, who researches games and history and introduces such video games as educational tools in universities and schools.\n","What is crucial, he points out, is that the games are credible. They give players an \"impression of an era that couldn't be obtained in any other way. No other medium can do that,\" Haasis tells DW. \"You can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of an era, and that leads you to become curious about it; you might not have developed that interest otherwise.\"\n","He reports that many students have chosen to study history because they wanted to learn more about the past after playing \"Assassin's Creed.\"\n","Games also offer the opportunity to integrate historians' latest findings and contribute to remembrance cultureby sharing history in a more colorful way.\n","Historians have been involved in the development of \"Assassin's Creed Mirage\" since 2021. The team includes renowned experts such as Glaire Anderson from the University of Edinburgh, who researches Islamic art and architecture in the age of the Caliphs (650-1250), and Vanessa van Renterghem, who is specialized in the social and urban history of Baghdad's early era.\n","The studio also worked closely with museums.\n","\"I think it's very important that more and more historians open up about games,\" says Lucas Haasis. \"Because games are here to stay and are becoming more and more important.\"\n","For many young people, games are simply part of their lives. Haasis therefore sees a great opportunity in games that are based on history. \"We should encourage young people to be interested in history. At the same time,\" he adds, \"we should train their critical perspective,\" in order to allow them to recognize the differences between fact and fiction. They should all be aware that \"what is being presented is an illusion, a reconstruction by the developers,\" explains the historian.\n","Almost nothing remains of the original city, which was founded on July 30, 762, and grew up out of the desert sand within a few decades. What is known is that it had a circular layout, with the caliph's palace standing in the center.\n","The sparse documentation related to the city during that era allowed developers to be more creative in the depiction of the location. They used as sources of inspiration a book about Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate by English scholar Guy Le Strange (1854-1933), as well as contemporary travel reports and archaeological finds.\n","Players are now free to explore this magnificent city, riding a horse or a camel, or walking through its busy streets, and marveling at its mosques with turquoise domes shining in the sun.\n","Items are collected throughout the game, including in recreated historical locations, and they offer more information about the history of Baghdad.\n","The sometimes confusing story in the \"Assassin's Creed\" games always revolves around the conflict between Templars and Assassins or their predecessor organizations, the Order of the Elders and the Hidden Ones. This is also part of the narrative in \"Assassin's Creed Mirage.\"\n","The games have always featured solid gameplay, without, however, revolutionizing the genre. It can therefore be assumed that the historical settings are the main draw in the \"Assassin's Creed\" series, which counts 155 million fans worldwide, according to the games' developing company, Ubisoft.\n","\"I think there is a basic interest in us as humans to think about where we come from. At the same time what appeals to us about history is the strangeness of the past era; there's an almost constant interplay between this familiarity and strangeness,\" says historian Lucas Haasis. \"Time travel in a video game combines both levels at the same time. And these virtual journeys naturally take place in a protected space; you have nothing to fear. That's what makes diving into the past in games so appealing.\"\n","Anyone who — like the author of these lines — has played every title in the series will feel immediately taken by \"Assassin's Creed Mirage,\" which is released for all gaming platforms on October 5, 2023.\n","Basim, a supporting character in \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla\" (2020), takes on the main role in the new game. Many tasks and game mechanics from the beginning of the series have been implemented, such as following or eavesdropping on characters, observing guards' paths, or the useful eagle eye that highlights enemies and treasure chests. If danger is imminent, it is advisable to go into hiding or tear wanted posters from the walls.\n","Since he is not a tough guy, Basim has to act from the shadows — or more specifically, from a haystack or the bushes — in order to sneak into palaces or enemy areas. If he is discovered, escape is his best option.\n","He practices parkour to make his way over the roofs of the city, using the countless wall ledges, wooden beams, pulleys, stacked boxes and taut ropes to quickly get away. The city's dense development is ideal for urban parkour expeditions.\n","The story typically revolves around the eternal conflict between powerful secret societies and the quest for the shards of Eden, powerful artifacts that can rob people of their free will. But the storyline is admittedly secondary to the excitement of immersing yourself in another era and drifting through a bustling and opulent city — from the comfort of your own home.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n"," \n","'EU enlargement: Is the bloc ready for new members? 02.10.2023'\n","Since February 2022, a new consensus has settled in Brussels: The European Union needs to grow larger. EU members once considered enlargement skeptics now agree that it's time to start thinking seriously about welcoming hopefuls like Ukraine, Moldova and Western Balkan states into the club.\n","The shift was prompted by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Before then, loose plans for expanding were Brussels' favorite proverbial can to kick down the road, passed from one administration to the next while aspirant members such as North Macedonia — an EU candidate since 2005 — jumped through a series of shapeshifting political and judicial hoops to qualify for access without ever exiting the waiting room.\n","These days, the mindset has changed. As one EU diplomat put it: \"Enlargement is a reality now, and it wasn't a year and a half ago.\"\n","But Brussels has its own homework to do if the political consensus is to become a practical path. \"Before you can have a realistic conversation with the countries coming in, we have to figure out what an enlarged EU would actually look like — and that's as far as we've gotten,\" the diplomat, who asked not to be named, told DW. \"We know the questions but we don't really know the answers to them.\"\n","The conversation has, however, begun. Earlier this month, a group of researchers commissioned by France and Germany unveiled a paper full of ideas on the workings of and pathway toward a larger union. Thu Nguyen, a senior policy fellow at the Jacques Delors Centre in Berlin, was among them. She told DW that rethinking how the EU takes decisions could prove most politically challenging.\n","The official list of EU candidate countries is long: Ukraine, Moldova,Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. Georgia and Kosovo are also considered \"potential candidates.\"\n","But even with 27 members, the bloc sometimes struggles to take action. Foreign policy moves like sanctioning Russia require unanimous backing, meaning negotiations can sometimes take months as member states hash out which products to ban or whose assets to freeze.\n","Changes to other policy areas like migration and asylum require support from a \"qualified majority\" of EU members — meaning at least 15 states which also represent at least 65% of the bloc's population. Last week, the limits of this political arithmatic were also on display when Germany greenlit reforms to a new rulebook for migration crises, only for fellow heavyweight Italy to swiftly walk out and leave the deal deadlocked.\n","Under the current system, Ukraine — with its population of more than 40 million — would become one of the most politically powerful countries in the EU. Meanwhile, each smaller Western Balkan state such as Montenegro — population circa 620,000 — or Albania with its roughly 2.7 million inhabitants — would add more voices into the mix.\n","\"The more the member states there are, the more risk of having veto players that block decisions,\" Nguyen said. That could prove even tougher for politically-loaded calls like blocking EU funds to countries accused of breaching rule of law standards.\n","Nguyen and her co-authors therefore suggest scrapping unanimity and recalculating qualified majority voting shares to make sure a bigger EU still has the \"capacity to act.\" Controversially, that proposal would also make it more difficult for big powers France and Germany to block agreement.\n","But such reforms would require a rewrite of the bloc's founding laws and need support from member states who would lose power in the reshuffle. And, as Nguyen acknowledges, \"the political mood currently is not very favorable toward treaty change.\"\n","\n","Then there's the question of how to divvy up EU funds across deeper economic disparities. Most EU candidates have a lower GDP per capita than the bloc's current poorest member Bulgaria — and with around a third of Brussels' current budget assigned to agriculture subsidies, the arrival of farming powerhouse Ukraine would radically shift the current disribution sheet.\n","Last month, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary announced plans for unilateral embargoes on Ukrainian grain to protect their own producers from potential price drops. For the EU's former trade commissioner Phil Hogan, this shows the rocky road ahead.\n","\"There's going to have to be huge institutional change, huge budget change and policy adaptation to the new reality,\" Hogan told DW. \"Ukraine is a huge country with huge agricultural interests. And the notion that you would overnight be able to deal with the issues of Ukraine becoming a fully integrated member of the European Union's agricultural policy is going to be a major challenge.\"\n","\"Even in my time, there were sensitivities around many trade issues with Ukraine,\" he added. \"It's nothing new to have tensions between Ukraine and Europe in relation to agriculture — but you can imagine the challenges are going to be ahead for the European farmers in the context of the Western Balkans and Ukraine and others becoming part and parcel of the family.\"\n","Still, Hogan remains hopeful: \"I am very much in favor of the expansion of the European Union and bringing into our European fold countries that otherwise could go into a different fold that we may not like,\" he said, making a thinly-veiled allusion to Russian influence.\n","\"Politics is about the art of the possible and I expect that the existing member states will stretch themselves and their citizens will stretch themselves to ensure that we have our neighbourhood in a less tense place.\"\n","There are all sorts of smaller questions about the functioning of a larger EU which also need answers: How many more lawmakers would enter the European Parliament? How many more official EU languages would there be? Could each country maintain a dedicated member of the European Commission?\n","Given the legal and political quagmire that likely lies ahead, some think it's time to broaden the definition of the bloc. This week, as Europe's leaders head to Spain for a third meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), one vision of a wider intergovernmental set-up is on display.\n","The EPC is the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron. When he first publicly floated the idea in 2022, Macron said it could take \"decades\" for Ukraine to join the EU, and argued for a new grouping that \"would allow democratic European nations\" to \"find a new space for political and security cooperation.\"\n","Today, the EPC is fomally nothing more than a talking shop, with no established structures, voting rights or treaties attached. But it is the only forum of its kind uniting its broad church of 45 invitees. It includes all EU countries and candidates, wealthy nations staying an arm's length from the bloc like Switzerland, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and even political rivals Armenia and Azerbaijan. Russia is not on the guestlist.\n","For Thu Nguyen and her fellow researchers, this looser structure could provide a clue about what might happen if the EU fails to agree on an expansion plan.\n","They suggest there could be a core \"inner circle\" of closely integrated EU countries, then the wider EU, then a next level of \"associate members\" who enjoy some benefits linked to the bloc's single market, and an \"outer circle\" based on the EPC, which Nguyen says would \"not include any form of integration with binding EU law… but rather a cooperation based on geostrategic considerations.\"\n","But this potential multi-speed approach may prove unpopular, seen by some as creating second-class citizens in the EU's club.

After months of uncertainty, it is now clear that Wagner and Henze expert Christian Thielemann will take over the prestigious role next year.\n","Berlin's Senator for Culture Joe Chialo, who is also the chairman of the Berlin Opera Foundation, thereby followed the recommendation of the opera's future artistic director, Elisabeth Sobotka, who will be leading the house from September 2024.\n","Thielemann has been chief conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden since 2012. But his contract there expires in 2024. His new contract at the Berlin State Opera will initially run for five years. From 2025, some 20 concert evenings per year are planned.\n","However, just one opera premiere has been announced by Sobotka. The reason for this is Thielemann's previously made commitments elsewhere for the coming season.\n","\n","Barenboim and Thielemann have known each other for decades. Already as a 19-year-old, Thielemann was assistant to the Argentine-Israeli composer and conductor.\n","In a welcoming address, the latter praised his successor as one of the outstanding conductors of the time: \"I have been at the helm of these so special musical institutions for over 30 years and I am certain that under Christian Thielemann's leadership they will continue to maintain and expand their exceptional position in Berlin and international musical life,\" Barenboim said. He was \"full of anticipation for what is to come.\" Sobotka called Thielemann a \"logical successor\" to Barenboim.\n","Thielemann is not lacking in ambition. He wants the orchestra to play \"everything — from the Christmas Oratorio to the Happening.\"\n","Nevertheless, he doesn't want to abandon tradition either. \"You can only do something new if you have both feet in the tradition,\" he said.\n","The 64-year-old and Daniel Barenboim have \"a close relationship,\" Thielemann told the media. Barenboim's influence on his career has been crucial, saying: \"I am in his debt.\"\n","Still, there have been asides in their long artistic and private relationship. The New York Times speaks of a \"complicated history\": when Thielemann was at the Deutsche Oper, for example, he complained about the much lower level of state support for it compared to Barenboim's Staatsoper. In addition, accusations were made that Thielemann had made antisemitic comments about Barenboim. However, Thielemann vehemently denied this.\n","The Berlin State Opera, or Staatsoper Unter den Linden, is a renowned house. The neoclassical theater was modeled on an ancient temple and was once the largest opera house in Europe.\n","No less a figure than Frederick the Great, a great friend of the arts and sciences, commissioned the construction of the State Opera.\n","Completed in 1743 by architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, the building was part of a large-scale urban development project, the Forum Fridericianum, which also included a library, a church and a palace.\n","The State Opera House has had an eventful history. It had to be rebuilt several times. In 1843 it burned down almost to the ground. During World War II, the building was massively damaged twice and then reconstructed.\n","The German capital maintains three state-funded opera houses: in addition to the Staatsoper, the Deutsche Oper in former West Berlin and the smaller Komische Oper. That's more than Paris, New York and London.\n","All three opera houses are known for putting innovative and avant-garde productions on the program. Violence and nudity are considered pillars of this, as are performances that cross boundaries between opera, film and contemporary art.\n","In the days of the GDR, the Staatsoper was the leading opera house in East Germany. According to findings by historian Ralf Stabel, it was teeming with spies from the GDR secret service at the time.\n","In his book on the subject, Stabel wrote that many dancers spied on their colleagues to prevent the threatened escape of the best dancers to the West.\n","After reunification in 1990, the Staatsoper was handed over to the city of Berlin.\n","Starting in 2010, for several years the State Opera made a guest appearance at the Schillertheater in western Berlin. The reason was a comprehensive renovation of the building, whose time and cost schedule was massively exceeded, but at the end of which the audience was rewarded by breathtaking acoustics.\n","\n","Christian Thielemann should now also be looking forward to these acoustics, which he is already familiar with. He has already stepped in as conductor twice before at the Staatsoper, when Barenboim was unable to conduct the Wagner cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen,\" due to health reasons. At the time, the audience had celebrated Thielemann with ovations, and the orchestra was also visibly taken with him. The beginning of his first rehearsal with the Staatskapelle, as the house's orchestra is called, was a \"magical moment,\" Thielemann says in retrospect.\n","After holding positions at the Deutsche Oper Berlin and Düsseldorf, Thielemann came to Nuremberg as general music director in 1988.\n","In 1997, he went to Berlin as general music director of the Deutsche Oper before holding the same post with the Munich Philharmonic, from 2004 to 2011. In addition to his post as principal conductor of the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden, he was artistic director of the Salzburg Easter Festival from 2013 to 2022. In 2022, he stood at the podium of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and performed Bruckner's Eighth Symphony.\n","It will not be easy for Christian Thielemann to succeed Barenboim, but the stage is set for him to further add to his burgeoning reputation.\n","\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'Devils and demons: New exhibition looks at the art of horror 24.09.2023'\n","Since time immemorial, horror has found its way into various art forms, whether in fairy tales, books, paintings, sculptures, songs or films. \n","Despite this long tradition, horror has long been denigrated for being a superficial genre. Curator Westrey Page hopes to demonstrate that is not the case with the exhibition \"Death and the Devil. The Fascination with Horror,\" on show at the Kunstpalast Düsseldorf.\n","In recent decades, the topic has only appeared marginally in major exhibitions, as Page tells DW. Unique in its approach, the exhibition explores how horror has inspired creators in all artistic fields, from fine art to fashion, from music to film.\n","The exhibition begins with a historical prologue that looks into how the arts and culture have been shaped by horror for centuries, from the fantastic demons of the Renaissance to the dark shadows in Romantic landscape paintings to various iconic characters from the early horror films of the 20th century, such as Nosferatu.\n","The prologue shows that throughout history, major artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow and Francisco de Goya also dealt with horror and dark dreams in their works.\n","\"Above all, my hope is that many visitors will then be able to interpret today's manifestations of horror differently, and perhaps have more respect for them,\" says the exhibition's curator.\n","Through 120 exhibits — paintings, illustrations and installations from various art forms from the past two centuries — \"Death and the Devil. The Fascination with Horror\" shows how certain horror devices have been revisited over time.\n","Excerpts from German Expressionist horror film classics such as \"Nosferatu\" (1922) or \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920) and posters from famous later horror classics such as \"The Exorcist\" (1973) or \"Halloween\" (1978) show the continuity with which horror has been inscribed in film history:\n","\n","Horror films can promote both conservative and subversive values. They can, for example, serve as a warning about the unknown, but they can also enable a change of perspective about social issues by asking the question: Who is the actual monster here?\n","Ever since the first \"King Kong\" film, the old hero-versus-monster formula has been challenged.\n","In many modern vampire films, the bloodsuckers are no longer the villains, but rather the main protagonists who have to find their way in a cruel society.\n","A recurring theme in horror is that a central unit is threatened by something that comes from the outside.\n","But this established storyline can also be used to swap roles, in which \"the monster, the witch, the vampire or the outsider can assert an empowered otherness,\" explains Westrey Page. \"And this can also be used to question social norms, to question systems of power. And that's ultimately what we're seeing more and more of in horror these days, in very different genres, including pop culture.\"\n","The exhibition shows, among other things, how the looks of the younger Goth scene influenced the creations of fashion designers such as Rei Kawakubo, Rick Owens and Viktor & Rolf.\n","The aesthetics of Gothic, Wave and especially Metal bands — whether on their record covers, their band T-shirts or the lettering used for their names — are heavily inspired by old myths that deal with horror and disgust.\n","Today, this symbolism also appears in pop music. Lady Gaga, for example, lovingly refers to her fans as \"Little Monsters.\"\n","Horror has been going through a renaissance in recent years, which is reflected among other things in the great international success of series such as \"The Walking Dead,\" or \"Monster High,\" a popular horror doll series from the Barbie manufacturer Mattel, in which figures like Frankie Stein or Draculaura wreak havoc. The franchise's advertising slogan is: \"Be yourself, be unique, be a monster.\"\n","\"So it's about celebrating and accepting one's own identity and differences,\" says Page.\n","When preparing the exhibition, she herself was surprised by the diversity of the horror genre: \"It can be serious, it can be socio-political, but it can also be charming. Horror can be fun, filled with black humor. It's just so diverse.\"\n","A sculpture by the US artist King Cobra with imitation flesh that explores the vulnerability of the body and the disgust that arises from it; an album cover by Lady Gaga, who is part motorcycle, part human; Max Schreck as Count Orlok in \"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror\": All three works cross borders, and can open the mind of the viewers through a moment of shock.\n","\"I think that horror gives us space to process our own fears and ultimately see our society from a different perspective,\" says Page.\n","The exhibition \"Death and the Devil. The Fascination with Horror\" is on through to January 21, 2024 at the Kunstpalast in Düsseldorf. Recommended for ages 12 and up.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","\n","\n","\"Nudity, blood and pain: Revisiting Marina Abramovic's work 22.09.2023\"\n","The UK's Royal Academy of Arts is dedicating a major exhibition to iconic Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic. It is the first retrospective to be given to a female artist in the institution's history.\n","The exhibition revisits Abramovic's artistic legacy through sculpture, video, installation and performance. Different works are re-staged through video archive footage; others are reperformed by a new generation of artists.\n","Born in Belgrade, Serbia in 1946, Marina Abramovic studied art both in her hometown and in Zagreb, Croatia. Early on she developed an interest in performance art, including experiments with sound installations.\n","In 1973, the young artist was invited to Edinburgh, Scotland, for an international art festival, where she debuted her first provocative performance work.\n","Titled \"Rhythm 10,\" Abramovic thrust 10 sharp knives between her splayed fingers — a daredevil act in which she occasionally missed and drew blood. In Edinburgh, where the young artist and occasional painter met iconic German performance artist Joseph Beuys, she also realized she had found her medium.\n","\"I had experienced absolute freedom — I had felt that my body was without boundaries, limitless; that pain didn't matter, that nothing mattered at all — and it all intoxicated me,\" recalled Abramovic of that first performance in her 2016 autobiography, \"Walk Through Walls.\"\n","\"I was drunk from the overwhelming energy that I'd received. That was the moment I knew that I had found my medium. No painting, no object that I could make, could ever give me that kind of feeling, and it was a feeling I knew I would have to seek out, again and again and again.\"\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Abramovic has since carved a reputation as a pioneering performance artist who continues to test her physical and psychological limits.\n","Arguably her most provocative early work was 1974's \"Rhythm 0,\" a performance in Italy, this time in Naples. In it, Abramovic directed the audience: \"There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.\"\n","The objects included razor blades, knives and a loaded gun. The artist sat motionless as people cut open her clothes or slashed her skin. One person aimed the loaded gun at her head. \"If you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you,\" Abramovic said after the performance in which she sought to expose an inherent human cruelty.\n","Earlier that year, her performance \"Rhythm 5\" included a burning communist star. She laid herself in the middle of it after cutting and burning her hair and nails. When the fire had consumed all the oxygen, Abramovic passed out.\n","This career path was soon taken in tandem with German artist Frank \"Ulay\" Uwe Laysiepen, who in 1976 became Abramovic's lover and collaborator for 12 years.\n","The 1977 performance \"Imponderabilia\" was typical of their oeuvre; Abramovic and Ulay stood at the entrance of a Bologna museum naked, forcing visitors to squeeze past them to enter.\n","This work is now reperformed by other artists at the Royal Academy. Here too, visitors must squeeze between two nude models to enter the show. There is, however, a separate entrance for those who are uncomfortable with participating in the unusual performance.\n","Marina Abramovic and Ulay lived as free spirits in their small Citroen bus for four years, traveling through Europe and performing.\n","Even their separation in 1988 was sealed with an elaborate performance. In a piece titled \"The Lovers,\" they walked towards each other along the Great Wall of China, starting at opposite ends and meeting in the middle. After covering some 4,000 kilometers (2485 miles), they said goodbye.\n","The separation inspired the artist to break new ground.\n","In 1997, she performed a work in the international section of the Venice Biennale titled \"Balkan Baroque,\" a comment on the Yugoslav Wars, in which she spent seven hours a day washing a mountain of bloody cow bones. Her performance was awarded a Golden Lion.\n","Since the 1990s, she has also been teaching her \"Abramovic Method\" to young performance artists. She moved to New York in 2000, where she developed theater pieces, performances and encounters with other artists, despite some local reticence to her work.\n","In \"House with the Ocean View,\" the artist spent 12 days living without food in three open rooms, in which she created an intimate relationship between herself and viewers.\n","The theme continued in a 2010 performance at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), \"The Artist is Present,\" in which she locked eyes with audience members at a table from a wooden stool in which she sat for six hours a day for 75 days — stars like Sharon Stone, Tilda Swinton, Björk and Lady Gaga made use of the chair.\n","Former lover Ulay, who she had not spoken to in years, famously showed up without warning and stared across at the star artist. They both cried. \n","In the decade since, her works have been characterized less by violence and more by asceticism and recollection. Her method is based on a mix of various esoteric and eastern relaxation and meditation exercises. She spends every year's end in a monastery in India to meditate and recharge her batteries. \"We have to create situations where our bodies are healthy and function well,\" she said. \n","The Serbian artist has been accused of trying to evolve from artist to shaman, though she has also suffered much worse throughout a provocative career. In 2018, for instance, she was attacked with a portrait of herself while she held a book signing for, \"Marina Abramovic Interviews 1976-2018,\" in Florence, Italy. After the incident, she returned to her hometown of Belgrade to kick off her retrospective \"The Cleaner.\"\n","In 2020, Abramovic debuted the operatic project, \"7 Deaths of Maria Callas,\" at Munich's Bayerische Staatsoper. In it, she re-enacted seven of Callas' most famous on-stage deaths. \"Like many of the opera heroines she created on stage, she, too, died of love. She died of a broken heart,\" said Abramovic of the star — whom she greatly admired. \n","Earlier this year, the performance artist had a brush with death that wasn't induced by one of her extreme performances.\n","During a minor operation at the hospital in May, she suffered a pulmonary embolism that led her to undergo three operations and nine blood transfusions. She was in intensive care for six weeks, spending some time in a coma. \n","To deal with the difficult episode, she used all the skills she had developed through her performances: \"breathing, dealing with pain, working with consciousness,\" she explained at the inauguration of the exhibition at the Royal Academy. \n","\"We are so afraid of pain. I don't like pain, but I think that pain is such an important element in human life,\" she said. \"Suffering is like a kind of gate in order to understand the universe, in order to understand yourself.\"\n","The exhibition \"Marina Abramovic\" is on show from September 23, 2023 to January 1, 2024 at the Royal Academy in London.\n","This article is an updated version of a previous profile, first published for Marina Abramovic's 75th birthday on November 30, 2021.\n","Edited by: Sarah Hucal\n","'Will AI revolutionize or ruin video games? 19.09.2023'\n","\"That's ultimately the utopia of AI that I imagine: Everyone's just more creative. We'll have more beautiful digital experiences. People will become closer together through these shared creative experiences,\" says Sasha MacKinnon, founder and managing director of Mino Games. \"I think it's possible, we just got to do it right,\" adds the Australian, a self-confessed \"Pokemon nerd\" who started developing games at the age of six.\n","MacKinnon's enthusiasm is contagious; he beams as he talks about the opportunities that lie in the use of artificial intelligence — AI for short — in game development.\n","Many other gaming insiders have come to a similar conclusion. According to a study by management consultancy Bain & Company, published in September 2023, the majority of the gaming industry executives surveyed believe that AI will be involved in half of the development process in the next five to 10 years.\n","For example, in the role-playing game \"Dimensionals,\" developed by Sasha MacKinnon's studio, AI is built into a particular character who is a slightly crazy nice guy, brimming with creativity, who always joins the others at the table and keeps making one funny suggestion after the other.\n","AI can generate characters, fights and dialogues: \"We're using AI to have these magical moments where the characters just say something that you totally didn't expect that really isn't scripted and is based on your history of playing with them.\"\n","For now, AI quickly reaches its limits: 40-50% of its suggestions are unusable, says MacKinnon. So at Mino Games, AI serves as creative collaborator who provides ideas that are then implemented by humans.\n","The sketches of the monsters for \"Dimensionals\" were generated by AI, but the monsters that appear in the game were created by human designers.\n","Game developers don't have to worry about their jobs, says MacKinnon. They cannot be replaced by AI, he believes, adding that \"games are the purest form of human expression,\" as they not only combine story, art and sound, they also offer \"an experience for people. AI will never, ever be able to do that as well.\"\n","Daniel Landes does not share this optimism. He works as a freelance translator and adapts international games into German, including \"Hogwarts Legacy\" and \"Overwatch 2.\"\n","Translators usually work as freelancers and are paid per word. Nobody gets rich from it. But now, as the use of AI is being required by game producers, they are also expecting translators to be paid less for their work — only 30% of the original per word price.\n","Translators would like to use the AI tools as an aid, like mathematicians use a calculator, explains Landes. \"The main problem is that we are forced to work for less money, even though it is not proven that work will be made easier.\" The more complex a text is, the worse the computer translation, requiring more editing work. \"The machine doesn't understand context, but rather calculates probabilities,\" says Landes. \"Especially with dialogues or creative texts, it's not about translating literally, but about capturing the meaning of the original. AI cannot do that.\"\n","The umbrella organization for audiovisual translators in Europe, AVTE, published a manifesto on AI translations in 2021, in which Daniel Landes was also involved. The authors warn of a loss of quality, question the efficiency of the tools and demand fair pay for translators.\n","However, there has been no improvement in the general conditions so far. \"Because most translators are freelancers, it is incredibly difficult to organize as a profession. Many translators have to struggle very much to even make ends meet.\"\n","It's not just in Germany that the profession is facing difficult times. \"All translators worldwide are under pressure,\" says  Landes. \"We see the same problems everywhere: Our names are not mentioned in the credits, our fees keep being lowered and we have no say or right to negotiate.\"\n","AI is only as good as the data it is fed with. In addition, it is by no means certain that AI will improve over time. It can also get worse, as researchers have found using ChatGPT as an example.\n","It is therefore not unreasonable to think that the quality of games will be affected if AI is increasingly used.\n","But since the technology is often faster and significantly cheaper than human translators, game designers or copywriters, it could still prevail and lead to people losing their jobs and studios simply accepting lower quality as the lesser evil.\n","\"One of the biggest risks of AI is that people become complacent,\" says game developer MacKinnon. \"And this is one of the big things about AI in general: We're at these crossroads.

And it should encourage people to develop their own stories and games. He expects a flood of new games from people who have never developed a game before, but are now able to do so thanks to the technical possibilities.\n","In fact, the most successful games in recent years have come about because existing games were modified and further developed by the community — i.e. by the players themselves, not by the game industry.\n","Among others, \"Counter-Strike\" emerged from a modification of the first-person shooter game \"Half-Life.\"\n","\"Fortnite\" is a variant of \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,\" whose battle royale concept — 100 players compete against each other and the last survivor wins — was invented by a so-called \"modder,\" a term used to describe those who redesign games by creating new levels and maps.\n","One possible scenario is that using AI in game development will create more games, but the quality will drop, which means that more boring, mediocre games will be released.\n","On average, more than 30 new games are already appearing on the Steam gaming platform every day.\n","Additionally, AI — which can handle all tasks of game development, from graphics to copywriting to programming — makes it much easier for everyone to develop a game.\n","This means that more user-generated content could emerge in the coming years, which may also create new, successful genres.\n","After all, the development of technology — which was initially rather limited — has always had a significant influence on game development, starting with text adventures in the 1980s, followed by 2D platforms with pixel graphics in the 1990s, then detailed open-world games in the 2000s, and now popular multiplayer online games, which bring together dozens of players at the same time.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'How Louis Armstrong left his mark in East Germany in 1965 18.09.2023'\n","In March 1965, Louis Armstrong came to East Germany for a series of concerts. It was a tightly packed tour: The jazz superstar performed 17 shows in nine days in five different cities of the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR).\n","Around 45,000 East Germans saw him play live with his All Stars band.\n","The political background behind Armstrong's concert series turned it into an event that was both \"outstanding and ambivalent,\" said Paola Malavassi, co-curator of a new exhibition that takes the historic event as a starting point. \"I've Seen the Wall — Louis Armstrong on Tour in the GDR 1965,\" is now on show at Das Minsk, an art museum in the former East German city of Potsdam, right outside Berlin.\n","The Berlin Wall had been built less than four years earlier by the GDR; the satellite state of the Soviet Union was aiming to stop the \"brain drain\" of educated and skilled workers from the East to the West.\n","Amid Cold War propaganda, the GDR's ruling Socialist Unity Party increasingly hardened its stance toward popular music throughout the 1950s and 1960s. By the end of 1965, during its plenary session, the party officially unveiled its hard line against all cultural manifestations that were deemed to promote the West's \"nihilistic\" and \"pornographic\" values.\n","Jazz was also viewed suspiciously. GDR leader Walter Ulbricht is said to have described it as \"the ape music of imperialism.\"\n","But the GDR authorities' attitude toward the music genre also fluctuated from the 1950s to the 1970s, with some officials recognizing its power as the \"people's music\" because of its African American roots. \n","\"Satchmo,\" as Armstrong was nicknamed, had been invited by the Deutsche Künstler Agentur, the GDR state agency in charge of determining which foreign musicians could perform in East Germany, as well as which East German artists were allowed to play abroad.\n","Politically-toned speeches were held upon Armstrong's arrival in Berlin. The head of the GDR artists' agency, Ernst Zielke, praised the musician's visit as a symbol of peace and socialism, calling it a celebration of the working class and friendship between peoples.\n","On the other hand, the United States was also keen to send jazz musicians to Soviet countries, as \"goodwill ambassadors.\"\n","The GDR had allowed the Armstrong concerts to take place in halls with a capacity of 2,000 to 3,000 seats, but it had also assigned the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, to surveil the concertgoers, fearing riots.\n","The tour is remembered as having given a boost to the East German jazz scene, with the music genre serving as a symbol of freedom, as noted by jazz musician Jason Moran, co-curator of \"I've Seen the Wall,\" in a podcast released as part of the exhibition.\n","The title of the exhibition refers to a statement made by Armstrong at a press conference in East Berlin during the tour.\n","A West German journalist asked him to comment on the Berlin Wall dividing the city. In his answer, Armstrong avoided the political debate: \"I've seen the Wall … and I'm not worried about the Wall … I'm worried about the audience I'm going to play to tomorrow night!\"\n","However, he then added, \"I can't say what I want to say, but if you'll accept it, forget about all that other bulls***t.\"\n","The interpreter nervously chuckled, and did not translate Armstrong's reference to self-censorship into German, simply mentioning the singer's use of a \"strong expression\" along with his call to concentrate on the music.   \n","Zielke, the director of the GDR's artists agency, promptly closed the topic at the press conference by stating: \"Anyhow, it's interesting that the only political question of this kind is not from us, but from a Western outlet. We are delighted to note this.\"\n","Just as interestingly, even though they didn't refer to the GDR's state of affairs, all previous questions by East German journalists were equally political.\n","They were rather interested in finding out Armstrong's stance toward the civil rights movement. Just as the influential trumpet player was touring East Germany, the Selma to Montgomery marches were taking place in the US. The non-violent protests, held to demonstrate against the racial repression of African Americans, had Martin Luther King Jr. as their figurehead.\n","A few months previously, in September 1964, King had given speeches in West and East Berlin. In both parts of the divided city, he advocated reconciliation; the pastor and social activist also compared the divisions between African Americans and white people in the US and those between Germans living in communist and democratic systems.\n","King's emphasis on their common struggles was particularly moving for East Berliners — but made US officials nervous. The GDR and the Soviet Union often highlighted how racial violence in the US was a sign of the failure of the American society; East Germans were strong supporters of the civil rights movement. \n","Asked about the marches, Armstrong explained that his contribution to the movement was rather to play everywhere in his home country and to build connections with his white fans, even in the racially segregated South. \"I just do my little part, which some of them [the activists] don't do. But I do,\" he said at the East Berlin press conference.\n","By then, Satchmo was somewhat embittered of being accused by fellow Black Americans of not doing enough for the civil rights movement. Though the jazz icon mainly avoided politics, he did famously criticize the government's lack of action in the Little Rock Nine case in 1957, when nine Black students enrolled at a formerly all-white school in Arkansas faced horrendous treatment by those who were protesting against desegregation.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Many African American activists had maligned the jazz superstar for not being vocal enough, but as co-curator Moran noted, they came back over time and said, \"Well, actually, Louis was most profound in his activism.\" They had by then realized that there are different ways people could manage to \"get in the room to spark change.\"\n","And for Moran, that's what Armstrong did. As one of the first Black superstars in the US and internationally, Armstrong found \"his way inside rooms in a way that the person on the street doesn't. And they do need each other as a community of activists to spark a kind of change, possible change.\"\n","\"I've Seen the Wall.

This dark chapter of Germany's history has recently been the subject of films, art exhibitions and other theatrical works, and now, the first opera written by a Namibian composer will touch on this complicated history and what it means for the present relationship between the two countries.\n","Presented on September 15, 16 and 17 in Berlin's Haus des Rundfunks, the opera brings together performers from Namibia, South Africa and Germany, under the leadership of conductor and composer Eslon Hindundu, who leads the Rundfunk Symfonie Orchester Berlin, as well as Berlin's Cantus Domus Chor and Vox Vitae Musica, which is dedicated to Namibian choral music.\n","\"Chief Hijangua\" premiered in the Namibian capital of Windhoek in September of 2022; this will mark its European debut.\n","Present-day Namibia, named at the time German South West Africa, became a German colony in 1884, despite the land being long inhabited by the Herero and Nama people.\n","In 1904, the Herero people rose up against German colonial rule, and German military commander General Lothar von Trotha issued a notorious \"extermination order,\" which led to what has gone down in the history books as the one of the earliest and biggestgenocides of the 20th century. \n","The opera \"Chief Hijangua\" is set in an imaginary world that resembles the late 19th century and the landscape is similar to that of Namibia. It tells the story of Chief Hijangua's journey to find himself and how he encounters the German settlers. Yet \"Chief Hijangua\" does not directly tell the story of the genocide, explains the opera's co-director, Michael Pulse.\n","\"We're trying to avoid this idea that this story is based on somebody who has lived before, which is not the case. It is mirroring some of these events that have happened, but we do not tie it directly to the history of Namibia and Germany and the genocide, because it is set in a time period before that — when the German settlers arrived and these two cultures, the Germans and the Herero met for the first time,\" Pulse tells DW. In this sense, the opera is meant as a prequel to the horrors of the genocide on Namibian soil, he says.\n","In the Afrofuturistic world in which this opera is set, Germans and Namibians are united, explained Pauls. \n","Performers were not cast based on nationality: \"The Germans and the Namibians are playing the villagers; and the Germans and the Namibians are playing the settlers.\" Pulse and the team wanted to challenge the audience and test how they would view casting not based on skin color or nationality. \"Our major is Black, our pastor is Black, we have white soldiers, we have Black soldiers. So how do you feel when you look at this? Do you see the story or do you see color or race?\" asks Pulse of the audience.\n","After all, the themes dealt with by both groups represented in the opera— the German settlers and the Herero people — are the same: \"The story in both of these spaces deals with themes of power, jealousy, greed — the fact that women don't have that much control over who they marry, what they say, what they wear,\" explains Pulse. \"So are you seeing those things before you see race?\"\n","\n","Musically speaking, the work fuses classical Western music with African music, and features improvisation — an element lacking in the standard classical canon. This pays homage to Namibia's oral musical tradition.\n","The libretto is bilingual, in Otjiherero and German. The opera's composer, Eslon Hindundu, wrote in the program notes that this was was done to \"bring two nations together in harmony,\" as well as to \"open the minds and eyes of Namibians\" and \"reflect on the journey that Namibians have taken for today's current and future generations.\"\n","Indeed, one of the opera's goals is to unite Namibians through music. The team, including Pulse who is from Namibia and German director Kim Mira Meyer, traveled the country selecting props such as woven baskets and clothing items which are used in various regions of the country — and not only by one ethnic group.\n","Having the European premiere of \"Chief Hijangua\" in Berlin is packed with significance for Pulse: \"Our history has been connecting us from the day that we met and it will still continue connecting us, until the the day history evolves into something else. And that's why we brought it here.\"\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","\"Morocco's deadly earthquake destroys cultural sites 13.09.2023\"\n","In addition to the rising death toll and the thousands of people injured by the powerful earthquake that hit Morocco on Friday, several cultural landmarks have also been destroyed.\n","Morocco is home to nine UNESCO World Heritage sites, and the United Nations' cultural organization is making its first cautious assessments of the extent of the damage, though information is still incomplete.\n","According to UNESCO, several of the country's World Heritage sites have been severely damaged, including parts of the almost 1,000-year-old Medina in Marrakech. The Old City has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.\n","The city's most important landmark, the 12th-century Kutubiyya Mosque, has also been badly damaged.\n","The minaret of the Kharbouch Mosque in Marrakech's Jemaa el-Fnaa Square has collapsed. The Mellah of Marrakech, or Jewish quarter, is in ruins. The city's famous historic red sandstone city wall has numerous cracks, and parts of it have crumbled.\n","The city, which draws many tourists, quickly undertook clean-up work after the quake, and the first cafes have already reopened. But the situation looks much worse outside the urban center.\n","The earthquake's epicenter was in Al Haouz province in the High Atlas Mountains, where entire villages were devastated with high numbers of victims.\n","\"After a disaster like this, the most important thing is to preserve human lives,\" Eric Falt, regional director of UNESCO's Office for the Maghreb, told The Art Newspaper. However, Falt also emphasized the importance of assessing the damage and restoring tangible and intangible cultural heritage sites.\n","Of course, after a disaster, there are more immediate needs to be met — can people still be saved; is there enough food and drinking water; do people have access to safe shelter? But in a second phase, schools and cultural assets will need to be rebuilt, and plans need to begin as soon as possible, the UNESCO regional director added.\n","Photos on X, formerly Twitter, show numerous \"before and after\" pictures of buildings that were destroyed, including the mosque of Tinmal in the Atlas Mountains, one of the most important historical buildings in the country.\n","\"It is a symbolic place in the history of Morocco,\" said Falt. Its destruction represents an inestimable loss to Morocco's national heritage. The Tinmal Mosque was a contender to be listed as another World Heritage Site in Morocco.\n","Cultural monuments are important not only for tourists and historians but also for the local people affected by the disaster, explained Susann Harder, president of the international cultural property protection organization Blue Shield.\n","\"People have cultural rights,\" she told DW. \"It is important for them to be able to perform their ritual practices at funerals, and to find prayer rooms beyond the destroyed historic mosques, especially at this time.\"\n","Rituals and religious holidays strengthening the sense of community can provide stability in difficult times, she added.\n","Cultural institutions are, therefore, extremely important for people who have just lost everything, the World Heritage expert explained.\n","In Morocco, it is primarily the old towns listed as World Heritage sites, such as the Medina of Marrakech. When such areas are destroyed, people lose part of their cultural identity.\n","\"Such sites are not only important for tourism. Above all, they are living spaces,\" Harder said. The structures that make up cultural heritage sites have been developed over centuries and have been part of the people's everyday life as it's where they live, shop, pray and work, she added.\n","When natural disasters or wars damage such sites, people not only lose an important anchor but also part of their cultural memory. That's also how a Marrakech resident summarized it for Morocco's The National newspaper: \"It's a shock. Our identity is defined by these sites.\"\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'Francis Kere: Pioneer of social architecture 12.09.2023'\n","His home village in Burkina Faso had neither electricity nor running water. But Diebedo Francis Kere's father wanted to offer his eldest son a better future. He was the only of 13 siblings to be sent to school, at the age of 7.\n","That privilege, however, meant that he had to leave his village. Far from his family, he sat with more than 100 children in a dark and stuffy classroom that frequently overheated.\n","That's when he started dreaming that he would one day build better schools with natural light and better air circulation.\n","Today, Francis Kere is one of the world's elite architects and a leading voice in sustainable design.\n","In 2022, he became the first Black architect, and the first one from the African continent, to receive the prestigious Pritzker Prize — an award seen as the \"Nobel Prize\" of architecture.\n","On September 12, the Japan Art Association honored him with the Praemium Imperiale for his life's work.\n","Francis Kere, who was born in the small village of Gando in 1965, moved to Berlin as a young man thanks to a scholarship.\n","He first completed vocational training as a carpenter in the German capital before starting to study architecture at Berlin's Technical University in 1995.\n","While still a student, he completed his first major project, building a primary school out of clay in Gando — light and airy, just like the one he wished for as a child.\n","For his respectful use of resources and his environmental approach, he received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004, the first of many honors.\n","He almost didn't return to university, but his professors convinced him to complete his studies.\n","In 2005, he founded his own office in Berlin, Kere Architecture.\n","He now has both German and Burkinabe citizenship. His internationally acclaimed projects include the \"Opera Village Africa\" initiated by the late German theater and film director Christoph Schlingensief.\n","With the construction of the elementary school in Gando, Kere demonstrated how the oldest but also most ecological building material in the world can be used in a more modern and resistant way.\n","Kere's bricks are made of clay, which has been used in the Sahel region for centuries due to its temperature-regulating properties,. He also makes use of laterite, a soil type that has a rusty-red coloration due to its high iron oxide content. A little bit of cement is added to the slightly moistened earth that is pressed into bricks, which makes them strong and waterproof.\n","The building's design is so clever that it does not need air conditioning to remain cool, working with natural air circulation instead. Kere also designs his buildings in harmony with the path of the sun, integrating natural shade into his concepts.\n","\"For a better future for all of us — not just in Africa, but for all of us on this planet — it is important to go back and actually only use materials that nature freely gives us and to stop over-exploiting them,\" Kere told DW while working on one of his latest projects in Senegal, the Goethe Institute in Dakar.\n","Dealing with the extreme temperatures is one of Kere's key concerns. The roof of his building in Dakar is literally its crowning glory. \n","\"Like the crown of a tree, this structure provides shade and protection. Here you can meet or simply relax,\" he said at the presentation of the building project.\n","Whether in Dakar or in Benin, where he is currently building the new parliament building, Kere's approach follows traditional rules and is based on a holistic concept, largely involving local workers.\n","\"Building is a big task and it requires many, many people to work together; people who also have a lot of experience and pass on their knowledge to the next generation,\" said the architect. \"That means it's a community event, and I've integrated that idea into my projects.\"\n","Remaining true to his first design, the village school in Gando, Kere is committed to architectural designs filled with air and light which harness the local community's energy and convey identity and pride. \"Of course I want to create quality and comfort. But above all, I want the result to inspire people,\" he said.\n","This is also the case in his current project, the Parliament of the Republic of Benin, which incorporates the traditional African \"palaver tree\" — which refers to the African custom of regularly meeting to build social ties and settle disputes without violence at a set location, often a tree. It stands for democratic values and cultural awareness.\n","The Praemium Imperiale is one of the most important arts prizes in the world.\n","The prestigious global arts award is given every year in five different fields — along with Kere's prize in architecture, this year's winners are Vija Celmins in painting, Olafur Eliasson in sculpture, Wynton Marsalis in music and Robert Wilson in theater/film.\n","Each prize is endowed with 15 million yen (€95,000/$102,000).\n","The Praemium Imperiale has been awarded annually since 1989 by the Japan Art Association. The Japanese imperial family created it to commemorate Prince Takamatsu, who died in 1987.\n","The award ceremony will take place in October in Tokyo.\n","Previous winners of the Praemium Imperiale include architects such as Norman Foster and Rem Koolhaas, director Martin Scorsese, photographer Cindy Sherman and German painter Georg Baselitz.\n","As a young boy in Burkina Faso, Francis Kéré dreamed of one day becoming an architect.

The 37-year-old was born more than a decade after Pinochet’s violent coup ousted the Marxist president, Salvador Allende, on September 11, 1973, but like many Chileans he too has had to grapple with its aftermath.\n","In an exclusive interview with DW's Jenny Perez to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1973 coup, Boric spoke of the current role of the armed forces, the challenges faced by his government and the changes he himself has undergone since he was elected.\n","\"Taking office as president of Chile means you have to adapt when it comes to certain things. You are ruling over an entire country, and, therefore, you represent the whole of Chilean society, those who voted for you and those who didn't,\" said Boric, who is also the leader of Chile’s left-wing Social Convergence Party.\n","\"But my longing for social justice, for social transformation, for progress toward a fairer distribution of wealth, toward a total end to discrimination against women and sexual diversity, toward a development that is just and integral, remains intact,\" he said, adding that he remained \"a person with left-wing convictions.\"\n","These political positions, and the fact that Boric is Chile's most progressive head of state in the past 50 years, have influenced the commemorative events around the anniversary of the coup and Allende's death on September 11, 1973.\n","Boric said that given the chance he would thank the president [Allende] for his commitment, courage and sacrifice.\n","\"I would tell him that we are working hard to follow in his footsteps, hoping 'to continue opening great avenues again, where free men and women can walk together to build a better society,'\"\n","Boric said citing from the last speech Allende ever made on the day he died.\n","It remains unclear to this day whether Allende's death was suicide or murder.\n","The repercussions of Pinochet's dictatorship still divide much of Chilean society. Boric had campaigned for a bigger event marking the anniversary of the 1973 coup, but according to a survey by pollster Pulso Ciudadano at least 60% of Chileans were not interested. \n","A \"Pact for Peace,\" an effort introduced by Boric's predecessor to resolve the social and political conflict that has triggered countrywide protests since 2019, was also divisive. During his presidency, Boric has attempted to improve coexistence through minimum agreements of democratic respect, including the rewriting of the constitution, but the country's right-wing and center-right parties have not supported his efforts. He has championed the idea of a \"Pact for Democracy.\"\n","\"We continue to have differences as to why this institutional breakdown is taking place, and I see with concern that there are many right-wing leaders who insist on the idea that without Allende, there would have been no Pinochet,\" said Boric. \"When you think about what that means, it is very worrying. It means that should there be another constitutional government they do not like and a climate of polarization and political difficulties, then the answer is a coup d'etat and a dictatorship.\n","\"I hope Chilean society agrees with me when I say that we will always solve the problems of democracy with more democracy and not less. And that nothing will ever justify violating the human rights of those who think differently,\" he said.\n","Boric believes it's a positive development that all of Chile's living ex-presidents, including the center-right Sebastian Pinera, have signed the Pact for Democracy.\n","When asked about Chilean society taking a possible ultraconservative turn and the increase in more radical visions from all sectors, Boric told DW he was worried. He stressed the need for the government to respond to the \"needs of our citizens.\"\n","\"In Chile, we have been waiting 10 years for a pension reform. Not only do pensions not go up, but the trust Chileans have in democracy as a mechanism for solving their problems is weakened,\" he said.\n","\"Democracy, from my point of view, is an end in itself, and we have to be looking after it constantly, watering it, caring for it,\" he said, adding that it was \"based on consensus.\"\n","\"The art of politics, the art of fair policies, is to reach agreements among those who think differently for the sake of a shared common good. And when societies become polarized, that shared common good can seem distant.\"\n","However, Boric said he did not believe there was a danger of the events of September 1973 being repeated in Chile: \"It would be irresponsible of me to say so,\" he pointed out.\n","He also highlighted recent policy achievements, such as mining royalties or reducing the work week to 40 hours, as examples of how Chilean democracy can function.\n","\"I believe that the opposition is playing a role, which has indeed resulted in a blockage to certain reforms, but it is part of how democracy works, and it is up to us to seek and explore new ways of reaching agreements,\" he said.\n","And the role of the military? \"Now, I am certain that the armed forces are not looking to engage in any kind of adventure and that they are steadfast constitutionalists and respectful of the constitution and the rule of law,\" Boric stated.\n","The Chilean president's confidence lies in the strength of the country's institutions but he recognizes that maintaining democracy is an ongoing process.\n","\"Chilean democracy is a democracy that is still under construction. I would not say that there is a moment when democracies are fully consolidated because societies change, and with change comes new challenges,\" he said.\n","\"The inclusion of the feminist movement in our society, for example, has been very organic given the way politics was understood until 10 years ago. The old idea of infinite development at any cost is not only being questioned today. It is seen as something that could endanger the very survival of humanity. So democracies are constantly perfecting themselves.\"\n","Referring to the fact that the Chilean dictatorship came about in the context of the Cold War, which led to numerous military regimes in the region, Boric pointed out that \"the power of arms is very meager. It vanishes with time. Bodies can disappear, people can be murdered, comrades can be tortured, but the dignity of those who fell and those who fight for a free country always ends up prevailing.\n","\"And this is valid for the history of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and so many other Latin American dictatorships — or the world,\" he warned.\n","Since his presidency began in 2022, Boric has also stood out on the international stage for his condemnation of leftist dictatorships in the region. In this regard, the president said he wasn't afraid of criticism.\n","\"I am convinced that, in terms of human rights, we must have a single standard, both from the historical point of view and from a whole of society point of view, and therefore, we cannot go around choosing which autocracies we like and which we don't like,\" he said.\n","\"If we value and defend democracy and, in particular, the universal respect for human rights as an advance of humanity, we have to defend it from the left, center, and right, whether we are red or blue. And I will stay firm on this no matter who it bothers.\"\n","Boric also spoke in favor of the recent gesture by the United States to declassify documents outlining the role of the world power in the 1973 coup.\n","\"The US ambassador to Chile has been very open to it. Some documents have already been declassified, and I believe that the position of the United States today is clear when it comes to condemning what happened,\" he said.\n","\"However, we can always do more. The Nixon administration at the time made every possible effort — and this is all documented — first, to prevent President Allende from taking office and then to hinder and create the conditions of chaos that allowed for the coup.\"\n","US President Richard Nixon's administration was heavily involved in the events leading up to the coup in Chile, with the CIA helping to finance opposition efforts to organize strikes by truck drivers and shop owners. The US also backed Pinochet's government despite his regime's human rights record.\n","Boric said that he would ask for information on the alleged collaboration of the West German intelligence service with the Pinochet dictatorship and the German sect Colonia Dignidad, which cooperated with the regime.\n","\"I have talked about this with Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz the few times I have met him. From what I have seen, I think he is keen to collaborate in everything related to the investigation and recognition of what happened in Colonia Dignidad,\" said Boric.\n","There has been an agreement to install plaques in memory of the victims of the German sect, although there have been no significant advances on that front. Boric said that \"just a bit of willpower\" is needed for that.\n","\"What is clear to us is that there are still many dark elements around, even 50 years after the breakdown of democracy in Chile. Therefore, we will continue to fight for truth and justice.\" \n","This article was originally written in Spanish.\n","\n","\n","'Saudi Arabia: Will football stars have a political impact? 10.09.2023'\n","Last week, German professional footballer Toni Kroos told journalists that Saudi Arabia was ruining the game of soccer.\n","The former German national player was not alone in this complaint. Sports commentators and fans alike have criticized the fact that Saudi Arabia has recently been enticing some of the world's most famous football players to its domestic league with extravagant multi-million dollar salaries.\n","Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo, Brazil's Neymar, French striker Karim Benzema, Sadio Mane of Senegal and a number of others have all taken up contracts with teams in the Saudi football league. It is estimated their various deals might top $1 billion (€926 million) in salaries for around 20 international players.\n","\"In the end, it's a decision about money — and against football,\" Kroos said of the players who had left for Saudi Arabia, during an August interview with the German edition of Sports Illustrated magazine. \"And from that point, it starts to get difficult for the football we all know and love.\"\n","But could football also make life for Saudi Arabia's autocratic government more difficult? After all, the increased international scrutiny that comes with such high profile players also means more attention on the way Saudi Arabia is ruled as a monarchy, as well as its dire human rights record. Kroos himself said he wouldn't go to the Saudi league because of the human rights situation there.\n","Saudi Arabia's concerted campaign to play a much bigger role in international football is part of the oil-rich Gulf state's ambitious Vision 2030 plan. This aims to diversify the country's economy away from oil income and into sectors like tourism and entertainment.\n","Through various financial vehicles and sponsorships, the Saudis have also invested huge amounts in everything from golf, cricket, cycling, Formula One, tennis, wrestling and most recently, mixed martial arts.\n","Football wasn't always on the agenda. As James Dorsey, an expert on football in the Middle East, has noted, the first consultants to work on Saudi Arabia's national sports strategy were told to focus on individual sports — like tennis or golf — rather than team sports.\n","\"De-emphasizing team sports was intended to limit soccer's potential as a venue for anti-government protests,\" Dorsey, a senior fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and the author of the syndicated newsletter, \"The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer\" wrote in an August column.\n","There are plenty of historical examples of how football can be politically troublesome in the region.\n","In 1958, during the Algerian campaign for independence from colonial power, France, some of the best Algerian players caused controversy by defecting from the French football league to form their own, independent national team.\n","In 2000, Libyan football fans stormed the pitch in Benghazi after an unfair game against a club owned by the son of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\n","In 2011, hard core football fans in Egypt known as \"ultras\" played a significant role in the revolution that eventually toppled the country's long-standing dictator, Hosni Mubarak. And most recently, Qatar changed its own labor laws after international criticism before and during the 2022 football World Cup, which it hosted.\n","Despite such examples, the advisory to steer clear of team sports seems to have been ditched after 2018, when Saudi Arabia's ambitious Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented his hold on power.\n","The Saudi government now says its focus on football is about economic diversification, locals' health — over 60% of Saudi nationals are obese or overweight — and developing sporting infrastructure. Human rights activists disagree, arguing it's about \"sportswashing,\" the practice of using sports events as a way of distracting from such things as a country's repressive politics.\n","The answer most likely lies somewhere in the middle: The Saudi sports strategy is motivated by both internal and external political considerations.\n","Around two-thirds of the Saudi population is under 35 and football is the country's favorite sport. \"So I think that he [Mohammed bin Salman] realized you can't really build a sports sector without football,\" Dorsey suggested. \"He has to deliver on jobs and economic sustainability and sports is part of that. There are also non-economic factors,\" he continued.\n","\"To reduce the risk of challenges … most autocrats rely on a combination of repression, legitimation and co-optation,\" the authors of a 2022 paper, International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies, published in the American Political Science Review, explained.\n","\"So they're using [football] for both legitimacy and, to some degree, co-optation purposes,\" Adam Scharpf, one of the study's authors and an assistant professor of political science at the University of Copenhagen, told DW. \n","Having the world' best footballers playing in the country's own league impresses citizens and demonstrates that the country can play as an equal on the world stage, Scharpf said. \"Of course, you also have repression. And this is all combined in a strategic way.\"\n","It's something of a \"bread and circuses\" situation, both Dorsey and Scharpf agreed, referring to the ancient Roman adage that basically says when citizens are entertained and well fed, they won't bother with politics.\n","\"Essentially, what the government is now doing is saying: 'Well, if you want Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, we'll give them to you.'\" Simon Chadwick, a professor at the Skema business school in France, who specializes in the links between sports and politics, told The Athletic, a sports publication, in June. \"But the flip side to that is they do not want to be questioned. So far this year, there have been more arrests of people in Saudi Arabia for posting negative comments about the government than ever before. The contract is that you can have whatever you want, but don't question us.\"\n","After looking in detail at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, Scharpf and other researchers concluded that autocratic regimes are well aware of the double-edged nature of large sporting events and deliberately devise strategies to deal with those. These may include increased violence before and after an event and increased surveillance. \n","\"So in many ways, the sports event doesn't make things better for people living in the country, it makes them worse,\" Scharpf said.\n","In fact, despite all of the optimism about sports being a catalyst for positive social change, football is just a tool, Dorsey argued. Whether or not it brings change depends on circumstances and how political leaders choose to use it.\n","\"In 2011, when football fans played a major role in Egypt, there were several pre-existing conditions,\" he explained. \"You had widespread discontent and the stadium was one of the few places where that discontent could be voiced and where people had a sense of strength and numbers. Are those circumstances theoretically possible in Saudi Arabia? Sure. Is there any indication that's a realistic scenario anytime soon? Absolutely not.\"\n","Of course, football might still play a positive role at a personal or societal level. However when it comes to nationwide politics, neither Scharpf nor Dorsey think football is about to have any impact in Saudi Arabia. In fact, as Scharpf pointed out, he doesn't know of any robust scientific studies anywhere that show sport helps bring about political change at the top.\n","A brief search using Google offers another, albeit pretty unscientific, answer as to whether the Saudi strategy on football is succeeding at an international level.\n","A date-restricted search turns up around 10 English-language news headlines about Mohammed al-Ghamdi, the retired Saudi teacher recently sentenced to death for posting political opinions on X (formerly known as Twitter). That's in the week since Human Rights Watch issued a statement on his case.\n","In that same time frame, there were over 1,000 news headlines featuring the name of British football player, Jordan Henderson, one of the most recent high-profile recruits to the Saudi league.\n","Edited by: Rob Mudge\n","\n","\"Berlin club culture battles 'highway to hell' 09.09.2023\"\n","When the Berlin Wall fell nearly 35 years ago, cultural life soon flourished in the abandoned factories and buildings that were left behind.\n","Pioneering techno music clubs like Tresor, located in a bombed-out department store vault, and later Berghain — occupying a derelict GDR power station — were some of many that gave life to the remnants of war and division in Berlin. Global creatives, DJs and dreamers soon flooded in to join the party that has become synonymous with the city.\n","Yet these spontaneous, self-managed cultural venues have long been vulnerable to so-called Clubsterben, or club death, with many already lost to development, gentrification and pandemic restrictions.\n","More recently, the threat has been heightened by the potential extension of the A100 highway through Berlin. Around 30 clubs and cultural venues that grew up over decades lie in its wake.\n","The area in question, running north of the Spree River through Friedrichshain in the former East Berlin, has remained relatively free of development. But the 17th and final section of the A100 could flatten the entire precinct.\n","While Berlin's long-ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) opposed the extension, the new Christian Democratic Party (CDU) leadership supports it — as does the federal transport minister who has final authority over the project.\n","\n","Some of Berlin's most celebrated venues face eviction if the A100 goes ahead.\n","They include the popular riverside dance club, Else, constructed with converted shipping containers; About Blank, an industrial techno club complex run by a collective that once squatted the space; and Wilde Renate, a labyrinthine club and exhibition space located in a former tenement house.\n","But grassroots campaigning to stop the A100 has reached critical mass in recent months.\n","Following a similar action in 2022, a classical orchestra and choir blocked the A100 this April under the banner \"Make Music Instead of Concrete\" — and while performing the ACDC song \"Highway to Hell.\"\n","Meanwhile, the Berlin club scene joined forces with climate activists and local citizen initiatives on September 2 to put on a rave for 20,000 people to celebrate cultural life in the district. More than 1,000 attendees came as part of a bicycle demonstration that rode from Berlin's Transport Ministry and aimed to highlight the climate impacts of the highway extension.\n","The event, titled \"A100 wegbassen,\" which means to get rid of the freeway with loud bass, was partly organized by the Berlin Club Commission, the world's first self-organized network for club culture — and who in 2018 employed a similar theme, \"AfD wegbassen,\" to protest a far-right Aternative for Germany party event in the city via a techno street parade.  \n","\"With lots and lots of people we showed that building another highway is a project of the past. The city of the future focuses on people, not cars,\" said Fridays for Future in an Instagram post after the event.      \n","One of the impacted clubs, About Blank, said it was willing to stand in the way of the freeway for the sake of both club culture and to stop the climate-changing car traffic that the development will bring.\n","The collective behind the renowned techno club, founded 13 years ago, said it would help \"create a club-cultural barricade against fossil capitalism, which causes the climate catastrophe.\"\n","\"The highway extension is an anachronism, an old burden of the state-protected automobile lobby,\" it added.\n","Lutz Leichsenring, spokesperson for Club Commission, told DW that Berlin artists and activists had helped stop freeway construction in the 1980s when culturally vibrant tenement streets were due to be flattened in the Kreuzberg district in the former West Berlin.\n","\n","But while 1950s-era urban planning designed to create car cities is alive and well, Leichsenring believes rapidly rising costs alone could kill the final A100 extension long after the first stage was completed in 1958.\n","At a cost of €200,000 ($214,000) per meter of construction, the effort to pull down and relocate vast swaths of Berlin may no longer be viable, he believes — especially with costs and permissions not due to be approved until 2027.   \n","Moreover, the fact that car usage in Berlin has declined by 16% since the introduction of Germany's cheaper €49 monthly public transport ticket means alternatives, including bicycle lanes, are possible to what Leichsenring calls \"a very absurd project.\"\n","Nonetheless, the Club Commission spokesperson fears the lack of certainty could force clubs, theaters and museums to quit the area as they search for long-term security of tenure.\n","From Klaus Lederer of the Left Party (Die Linke), former Berlin senator for culture, to his current successor, Joe Chialo of the Christain Democratic Party (CDU), Berlin politicians of different political backgrounds have strongly supported Berlin club culture, noted Leichsenring.\n","This also relates to the growing economic power of the club scene, with a Club Commission study showing that Berlin clubs generated €1.5 billion in revenue for the city in 2018.\n","When Chialo, a former Green Party member, assumed his role as Berlin's culture czar in 2023, he said he wanted Berlin's clubs to be recognized as \"cultural sites.\"\n","\"Clubs are talent factories, make an important cultural contribution; they make inner cities more attractive [and] attract audiences,\" Chialo told Berlin newspaper, the Berliner Zeitung.\n","This relates to efforts by the Club Commission and others to have Berlin's clubs recognized as part of  UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2021.\n","\"This is important because Berlin's clubs have never been recognized as cultural sites,\" Sophie Kahrmann, DJ and director of Berlin's Anomalie Art Club, told DW during the Rave the Planet street party in 2022. \"Achieving cultural recognition is a way to observe its importance in Berlin and around the world.\" \n","DW contacted Chialo's office for comment on the potential impact of the A100 on the Berlin club scene but has not had a response. \n","Cultural and grassroots activists aim to continue to pressure government by drawing public attention to the issue.\n","From September 9 to 24, a post-industrial wasteland lying on the route of the next section of the highway will host the action,  \"Spectacle on the Highway\" (Spektakel auf der Autobahn). The two-week program includes live music, circus shows, theater and flea markets and aims to show what would be possible on the vacant site if the freeway wasn't built.\n","\"We want to show with our program what can actually take place here,\" said Konstanz, spokesperson for the collective organizing \"Spectacle on the Highway,\" as hundreds flooded into the catch music and performances on its opening day on Saturday.\n","Even if the highway was stopped, showcasing the cultural value of the site might also stop it being sold off to the \"highest bidder,\" she said, referring to the new construction projects encroaching on the land by the rail tracks — and flanked by the Wilde Renate nightclub and Zukunft, an outdoor music and cinema venue.\n","After the current two-week pilot project, the goal is to make the abandoned strip — owned by rail operator, Deutsche Bahn — a permanent cultural space, Konstanz said.\n","Such an effort to creatively explore the potential of the site is typical of the way club culture emerged in the voids of Berlin. \n","\"You always have to have space left for future generations,\" said Lutz Leichsenring of cultural life in what has long remained an \"unfinished city.\"\n","\"That's a big mistake, to develop everything.\"\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","\"Hitler's bronze stallions unveiled in Berlin 09.09.2023\"\n","In 1939,Nazi artist Josef Thorak created the two \"Striding Horses\" (\"Schreitende Pferde\" in German) for Adolf Hitler's New Reich Chancellery in Berlin.\n","Now the controversial three-meter-high and two-ton bronze sculptures are presented together in Berlin again for the first time, on the occasion of Open Monument Day on September 10. \n","One of the horses has been on display there for some time, while the second one is now being exhibited for the first time in 77 years following restoration work. \n","The showcase is part of the \"Unveiled. Berlin and its monuments\" permanent exhibition at the Spandau Citadel in Berlin, which exhibits other problematic works of art.\n","The story of the stallions — also named the \"Thorak\" horses after their creator — and their disappearance already fills an entire book.\n","For a long time it was not clear what had happened to the Nazi sculptures.\n","It was initially assumed that they had been destroyed during attacks on Berlin towards the end of the Second World War. Later, they were discovered on a Soviet barracks site near Eberswalde, northeast of Berlin.\n","But they disappeared from there when the Berlin Wallfell in 1989.\n","It wasn't until 2013 that the Berlin police received a photo that gave reason to suspect the horses might still exist. Along with the photograph was a tip-off that the horses were being offered on the secret art market for an amount in the millions.\n","That was the starting signal for Rene Allonge, an inspector at the Berlin State Criminal Police Office who specializes in art crime, to join forces with Dutchman Arthur Brand, perhaps Europe's most famous private art detective, to investigate.\n","\n","The duo were able to clarify that the horse sculptures being offered on the black market were the authentic Nazi bronzes.\n","\"It was clear to me that if we got the horses back, it would be the best story of my life,\" Brand told DW.\n","The story also involved Stasi agents — East Germany's secret police — and the Soviet occupation forces. The horses were smuggled in pieces across what was then still a border between two occupied zones, presumably to be traded in the West for hard currency.\n","Then in 2015, a nationwide raid resulted in the horses being seized from an art collector in Bad Dürkheim, near the city of Mannheim in southwestern Germany. It was never clarified whether he had obtained them illegally, and investigations were dropped when the statute of limitations lapsed.\n","After a years-long legal battle, the collector was finally willing to hand over the horses in 2022.\n","Brand published a book about the art crime. The case has all the elements of a thriller, he says, including its secrecy, Nazi sympathizers and the raid. No wonder Hollywood has already secured the film rights to the material.\n","The horses once stood just a few kilometers away from their current location in the citadel, in the garden of Adolf Hitler's New Reich Chancellery. The dictator's idea was that the sculptures would decorate the \"world capital Germania\" he was planning.\n","Describing the ways the sculptures convey Nazi ideology, Urte Evert, head of the City History Museum of the Spandau Citadel, points out that the stallions embody a certain idea of masculinity.\n","\"The neck is extremely large and powerful, the muscles are completely exaggerated. The whole thing radiates a certain violence,\" the historian says.\n","Like Arno Breker (1900-1991), Josef Thorak was one of the most important propaganda artists of the Nazi regime and made the horses for Adolf Hitler in the 1930s.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","There is another horse, but it was not given to Hitler. Today it stands on the site of a high school on Lake Chiemsee in Bavaria, having apparently landed there in the 1960s when the Thorak family used the sculpture to pay for a son's school fees.\n","While both horses are now on show at the Citadel Spandau, only one of them will be part of the permanent \"Unveiled\" exhibition, and another one will be kept in a display depot.\n","They stand next to other statues and busts that are considered problematic, and each tells its own story.\n","One stallion is now standing in close proximity to a recently discovered bust of Hitler, found in the summer during construction work in Berlin near the former Nazi Chancellery, and attributed to the artist Josef Limburg (1874-1955).\n","He is said to have made the work in his studio in the Berlin district of Lichterfelde in 1937. It is not known how the piece ended up on the city center. The nose could have been lost at the end of the Second World War, when many portraits of Hitler were destroyed.\n","Two marble heads from Arno Breker's studio are also shown in the display depot, as well as a sculpture by Arminius Hasemann (1888-1979).\n","The story of his \"Crouching N*,\" as the 1925 statue of the stereotypically depicted African woman was originally called, could fill a book of its own, especially its ending: The sculpture was smeared with paint and beheaded in 2020 — presumably in the wake of the global protests following the police's brutal killing of African-American George Floyd, according to museum director Evert.\n","But even before it was vandalized, it had already been decided that the statue would be removed from Berlin's cityscape.\n","The works of art in the display depot of the Spandau Citadel can only be viewed during guided tours and special events.\n"," \n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'Venice film festival: The tops and the flops 08.09.2023'\n","At some film festivals, it's the red carpets that stand out; sometimes it's the politics and the protests outside the theater that catch your attention.\n","At the best film festivals, however, the movies are the stars.\n","And so it was at the 80th Venice Film Festival. There was plenty of glitz and glamour —  Hollywood strikes non-withstanding, we still got to see Adam Driver, Priscilla Presley, Fanny Ardant and Mads Mikkelsen pose for the paparazzi — as well as protests against government abuse in Iran, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and a pop-up street protest condemning the festival itself, for its decision to pick three movies — Roman Polanski's \"The Palace,\" \"Coup de Chance\" by Woody Allen and Luc Besson's \"Dogman\" — whose directors have all been accused of sexual assault.\n","That was mostly background noise, however, compared to what was happening in theaters. The real show was up on screen and it was by turns important, fantastic, silly or downright lousy.\n","Some of the most important films in Venice this year were directed by women.\n","The first African American female filmmaker to have competition entry at the Biennale, Ava DuVernay turned Isabel Wilkerson's weighty, scholarly book \"Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,\" about the roots and enduring legacy of racism in American society, into \"Origin,\" a powerful and deeply touching love story.\n","She does so by linking the history and themes explored in the book — which draw links between theories of race and white supremacy in America to those in Nazi Germany and beyond — to Wilkerson's own story of writing it, in which she faced the tragedy of the sudden loss of her husband, mother and close cousin within a few short months.\n","Agnieszka Holland's \"The Green Border\" is a wake-up call for all those who have forgotten the horrors on the edge of Europe, brought about by the policies of the supposedly democratic nations within.\n","The Polish filmmaker dramatizes the plight of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East, who were lured to the Belarusian-Polish border by Belarusian government propaganda promising easy passage into the European Union and instead found themselves pawns in a geopolitical game. When the Polish government cracked down, they were stranded, left to struggle and starve in the swampy, treacherous forests between the two countries.\n","Members of Poland's far-right government have attacked the movie without having seen it, comparing it to \"Nazi propaganda.\" \n","Holland is one of European cinema's most unflinching historic witnesses, having explored the legacy of the Holocaust in the Oscar-nominated \"Europa Europa\" (1990) and \"In Darkness\" (2011) and, in \"Mr. Jones\" (2019), that of the Holodomor, the Soviet-imposed famine in Ukraine in the early 1930s. \n","Meanwhile, a few established directors were responsible for major flops. \n","Polanski's \"The Palace\" was a stinker, a nasty, unfunny class conflict — the set-up is a showdown between the rich and the serving staff at a New Year's Eve celebration in a swanky Swiss hotel. The clash opposing the have nots and the 1% has been done much better, and with many more laughs, by Ruben Ostlund in \"Triangle of Sadness\" or Mark Mylod with \"The Menu.\" \n","If this is to be the last film by the 90-year-old director of \"Chinatown,\" \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"Frantic,\" he's certainly decided to go out on a low.\n","Michael Mann, one of Hollywood's greatest living directors, who has been shut out of the studio system since his expensive (but quite good) mega-flop \"Blackhat,\" arrived in Venice with \"Ferrari,\" hoping the independently-made film starring Adam Driver as the legendary Italian auto maker Enzo Ferrari would turbo-charge his career.\n","The racing scenes, with gorgeous 1950s open-top cherry-red Ferraris, are thrilling but the film is a car crash.\n","Driver plays Enzo as a dour macho who bullies and bribes his way to the top, all while cheating on his \"Italian\" wife (Penelope Cruz speaking in her natural, Spanish, accent) with his \"Italian\" mistress, who, to quote a favorite reviewer, in Shailene Woodley's performance feels about as authentically Italian as Pizza Hut. I hope Italy files suit on the grounds of national defamation.\n","The silly came in the form of \"Dogman,\" another potential comeback movie from another one-time superstar director.\n","Luc Besson ruled the 90s action era with films like \"The Fifth Element\" and \"Leon: The Professional.\" His own galactic misfire — \"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\" — landed him in the Hollywood dog house. Multiple #MeToo allegations kept him there, even though Besson was cleared on one assault charge and denies any wrongdoing. \"Dogman\" is his shot at box office redemption.\n","The film stars Caleb Landry Jones as an abused boy who finds salvation in dogs and drag shows. Born in what looks like 1930s Alabama, he inexplicably grows up in modern-day New Jersey and, thanks to a Doctor Dolittle-esque ability to communicate with canines, he becomes a Garden State Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and helping the poor with the help of his four-legged shaggy army.\n","Besson's film feels like three or four movies smashed together — part action thriller, part coming-of-age sexual identity drama, part \"Home Alone\" with dogs — and is a crazy hot mess. I kinda loved it.\n","Jones is phenomenal. I don't know of any other actor who could transition from a shoot-em-up with Latino gangsters to lip syncing \"La Foule,\" as a drag Edith Piaf. They'll need to create a new category at the Academy Awards to give this Dogman his due.  \n","But the real standout at the 80th Venice Film festival, the truly fantastic, was Yorgos Lanthimos' \"Poor Things.\"\n","The Greek director was last seen on the Lido with \"The Favourite,\" a period drama that smashed up every convention of the genre only to reassemble the pieces into something much more interesting.\n","With \"Poor Things,\" the reassembling is literal. Emma Stone plays Bella Baxter, despairing Victorian housewife brought back from suicide and re-animated as a Frankenstein-like creature with the body of a grown woman and the mind of a child. But this Frankenstein monster is horny. And a feminist. Suffice to say her journey out of the patriarchy will be eventful. And hilarious.\n","Stone's performance is fearless, jaw-droppingly good, and packed with lines that will soon be quoted everywhere. (A personal favorite: \"I just have to go punch that baby\"). Put your money down now on Stone for best actress at next year's Oscars.\n","Don't bet on Harmony Korine's \"Aggro Dr1ft\" taking home much in the coming awards season. His new movie, if the term even really applies to this experimental work — shot entirely with infrared cameras, creating a flat, trippy, video-game aesthetic — is less interested in reinventing cinema than obliterating it.\n","Korine, whose anti-movie movies \"Gummo,\" \"Trash Humpers\" and \"Spring Breakers\" have earned him cult status among midnight screening fanatics, has done away with things like plot, character or even performance. His actors speak in flat monotones, repeating the same cliched phrases — \"I am the world's greatest assassin,\" \"I'm here for my money\" — and moving like badly animated characters in the cut scene of a first-person shooter, circa 2001. All played to a thumping soundtrack composed by EDM producing legend AraabMuzik.\n","Korine says he's less interested in \"plot\" than \"vibe\" and hoped his film would push cinema towards a new art form, one that fuses film, music and gaming. \"Aggro Dr1ft\" ain't that.

Europe is set to become a major market for the company which has a presence in 15 countries on the continent, including 17 showrooms in Germany.\n","In Munich, Shu stunned auto analysts by announcing a price tag of less than €45,000 for its SEAL compact executive fastback sedan, a price that may cause VW executives to break out in sweat.\n","Still VW sells more EVs in Germany than BYD or any other carmaker. But BYD has launched a price war in Europe that is challenging, if not threatening, legacy carmakers.\n","\n","VW countered the Chinese offensive by announcing that it will launch its own models in two years, with entry-level prices starting at €25,000. Asked if he was worried about the new competitors, VW CEO Oliver Blume told reporters that \"fear is a false advisor,\" and added that VW was focusing on its strengths and would counter the Chinese with confidence.\n","\"I think we have huge opportunities. We have great experience, we know how to build cars,\" said Blume.\n","BYD has a technological edge over German carmakers, as it's building more efficient batteries, without cobalt and nickel, at lower prices. VW has to rely on numerous cooperative ventures to source its batteries. The Germans are also lagging behind when its comes to state-of-the-art automotive software.\n","In all, 41% of exhibitors at the auto show have their headquarters in China. Contrary to the Asian onslaught, participation from other European automakers is underwhelming. Philipp Kemmler, head of European communications for Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor, told DW that Chinese carmakers tend to believe that \"if you can make it in Germany, you can make it anywhere.\"\n","Another auto expert, Stefan Bratzel from the Center of Automotive Management (CAM) in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, thinks the Chinese will have a \"big impact\" on the European auto market in the coming years.\n","As carmakers roll out their latest offerings, climate groups have vowed protests at the fair, including \"civil disobedience\" aimed at disrupting the IAA.

However, much like in other countries, the art market is heavily curated, and often the domain of the country's privileged elite is skewed toward certain themes, styles, aesthetics, and formal training.\n","The Pakistan Art Forum (PAF), established in 2014, aims to circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of art in the country.\n","It first used social media and digital platforms to feature more eclectic and inclusive artists and styles. After the pandemic, the forum also set up a physical address that serves as a safe space for artists, allowing them to push boundaries and start a dialogue about queer and LGBTQ identity politics, sexuality and power, all while challenging patriarchy — themes that are taboo in Pakistan.\n","\"Throughout the ages, art has been a medium of reform, resistance, used to highlight various social dilemmas,\" Imtisal Zafar, founder of PAF, tells DW. \"It is important for us to not only curate shows that are aesthetically appealing, but also to use art as a medium to shed light on various issues.\" \n","Human rights violations and atrocities against women in Pakistan have gained more visibility through social media and reports, and the situation is being increasingly denounced by artists challenging the country's patriarchal social system. Many of them have adopted a decidedly feminist stance.\n","Most notably, Shehzil Malik has gained international renown for her depictions of powerful Pakistani women and femininity. Her works deal with the everyday and structural misogyny faced by women.\n","While Malik's portrayals of feminine strength are almost otherworldly, fantastical and supernatural, Zainab Aziz is a young emerging artist showing feminine strength in another creative way by focusing on the mundane.\n","Aziz works primarily with oil paints and has a signature style featuring a monochromatic palette and large voids in her representations. Through black-and-white contrasts, she aims to highlight social hypocrisy.\n","\"My work revolves around female protagonists, the way they share their secrets and bond. I consider the female body as a landscape of a society which bears multiple stories within it,\" says Aziz.\n","Three pieces from her second solo show, \"Misty Tales of Women,\" document everyday, habitual moments of women's lives, depicting how they are expected to trust their surroundings and what society demands of them blindly.\n","Aziz, who has received training from Pakistan's College of Art & Design and the National College of Arts, recognizes that the institutions have allowed her to polish her artistry. Still, she laments the lack of connections for young and emerging artists to break through.\n","\"I have faced a lot of difficulties as a Pakistani artist, as we don't get the exposure we deserve, domestically or internationally. One has to struggle by themselves to make their name in the art world,\" says Aziz.\n","She points out that the Pakistan Art Forum is the only platform in the country that supports emerging and young talents. According to Aziz, PAF's unique proposition is that they help relatively new artists sell their work immediately by encouraging, supporting and guiding them to showcase their work in galleries and helping them get media exposure. \n","The founder of PAF, Imtisal Zafar, explains that his mission is to support artists with a diverse portfolio. He routinely visits university art shows of graduating students to discover new talent. He first met Aziz at her thesis show in 2017.\n","Same-sex sexual acts are banned by Pakistani law. Sodomy is a crime that can be punished with two years to a life sentence in prison.\n","Understandably, many LGBTQ people in the country lead double lives and engage in clandestine affairs, keeping their sexual identity a secret from their closest friends and family.\n","Ahmer Farooq boldly tackles LGBTQ issues in his art, shedding light on how gays are pressured into forced heterosexual marriages to uphold a façade of \"normalcy.\" \n","He explains that a gallery refused to show his work under his concept, which described how the art deals with gay forced marriages. \"I then changed the statement to edit out 'gay' and was allowed to show it. The same art, the same everything, but I had to realign my concept,\" Farooq tells DW.\n","He says that the press also often refuses to share his art and cover his shows, fearing backlash or legal consequences, as even openly discussing homosexuality can get one into trouble.\n","Farooq is grateful that PAF has never censored his art, showcasing his work without prejudice or modifying his concept.\n","The artist's unique style features vibrant colors to translate the hypocrisy of a sanctimonious society visually: \"It all looks bright and cheerful on the surface, but it is much darker if you look closer,\" Farooq points out.\n","His recent show, \"A Safe Space,\" has drawn considerable local and international interest, and Farooq will show his work in the US soon.\n","The artist feels safe spaces are essential to many people's survival, as marginalized people need a \"bubble to be themselves.\"\n","While his show shines a light on the challenges faced by the queer community, Farooq states that his work also comments on how we are all bound together in our humanity and simply want the same things: security, love, peace and empathy.\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'An Israeli filmmaker in Berlin: Ofir Raul Graizer 03.09.2023'\n","Israeli filmmaker Ofir Raul Graizer moved to Berlin 13 years ago, shortly after he finished his film studies at Sapir College in Sderot, a city in southern Israel which has been since 2001 the target of repeated missile attacks by Palestinian militants, due to its proximity to the Gaza strip. \n","Graizer found living in the war zone exhausting for more than one reason: \"Not just from running away from missiles, but also dealing with aspects of nationalism and violence from the Israeli side,\" \n","What he discovered in the German capital was completely different: \"Berlin was vibrant, fun, young, fascinating. It was nice to have some kind of calm life, it was a relaxed place. So, I ended up staying.\"\n","Many Israelis are moving to Berlin to find peace — a striking twist of fate, knowing that some 90 years ago, Germany was a life-threatening country for Jews. \n","Among his \"very small experiences\" of antisemitism in Germany, Graizer recalls passing by a group of teenagers listening to Nazi music and giving him nasty looks. \n","But he rather describes other incidents he experienced, such as the harsh reaction of a law enforcement agent after hearing the Israeli's accent, as being more \"anti-foreigner\" than antisemitic: \"I don't think anyone can look at me and say, 'Oh you're Jewish.' But my accent and appearance are obviously not white German,\" he explains.\n","For the filmmaker, antisemitism and hatred against foreigners \"exist everywhere in the world,\" and Germany is no exception. But he nevertheless sees the country as being at the forefront in \"promoting human rights, artistic freedom, education and arts. It's good to be a part of it,\" he adds.\n","\"Today, Germany is one of the safest places in the world for Jews,\" says Graizer, laughing lightly. \"I'm saying this with humor, but I feel much safer here as a gay leftist.\"\n","The 42-year-old filmmaker grew up in Ra'anana, an affluent city in central Israel with a considerable modern Orthodox community.\n","With his father being religious, and his mother secular, Graizer went to a secular school, but was brought up religiously: \"We were kind of strict; we had to eat kosher, and we wouldn't take the car on Shabbat,\" recalls Graizer. \"It created a lot of conflict. I hated it, especially when I was a teenager.\"\n","Graizer came out as gay at the age of 16: \"It was not an easy journey; it took some years. But now my parents accept it. A lot of people become softer when they grow older,\" says the director.\n","Graizer is best known for his feature debut film, \"The Cakemaker\" (2017), which won the Ecumenical Jury prize following its premiere at the Karlovy Vary film festival, along with seven Ophir Awards — Israel's version of the Oscars — and numerous other prizes in festivals worldwide. It was Israel's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars in 2019. \n","Still, success did not come easily for Graizer. It took him eight years to make \"The Cakemaker.\" After being rejected by 19 film funds, he managed to make the film on a shoestring budget of $90,000 (€82,000).\n","With the success of his first film, Graizer secured funding for his second film more easily, but this time he was faced with new challenges: \"America\" was shot in 2020, during the early stages of the pandemic.\n","He struggled to film under lockdowns, and the entire cinema industry was unsettled by the pandemic rules: \"'America' is a film made for the big screen. All the theaters and cinemas were shut down and we didn't even know if we would ever be able to show it,\" recalls the director.\n","But Graizer kept pushing forward. \"Every movie has its journey. You need thick skin, finding the people who believe in what you do and not to take things personally. \"\n","\"America\" tells the story of an Israeli swim coach who returns from the US to Israel after his father's death. Tragic circumstances lead to a complex relationship with his best friend's fiancée, a florist.\n","The Israeli, German and Czech co-production premiered at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and won the best actress award at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 2022.\n","Graizer's film, which will be released in Germany in 2024, is now being screened at the Israeli film festival Seret International, held in Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne from September 3-11, 2023.\n","The Israeli newspaper Haaretz compared \"America\" to Pedro Almodovar films, as it features bold colors and a melodramatic plot, though Graizer's work is more restrained and quiet than the Spanish filmmaker's typically exuberant movies.\n","Other critics have compared Graizer to German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder: \"It's an honor, but I never say that my work is like this or that; I do things the way I imagine them from my subconscious. I'm influenced not just by drama or melodrama, but also mafia, horror, and espionage films,\" explains the director.\n","There are many similarities between \"America,\" and \"The Cakemaker,\" which is also a romantic melodrama with a love triangle driven by grief.\n","In \"The Cakemaker,\" a young gay German baker loses his Israeli lover in a car accident. Shortly after, he travels to Jerusalem and gets a job at a café owned by his lover's widow. A tender relationship develops between the two, until his identity is eventually revealed.\n","Certain aspects of Graizer's personal life are echoed in his films. For example, his husband, a German the filmmaker met three years after moving to Berlin, is a production designer and florist, and he is the one who designed the lush flower shop and flower arrangements in Graizer's latest film.\n","Graizer's second passion is cooking. He has worked as a cook in restaurants, as a private chef, and as a cooking instructor in Berlin hot spots such as Goldhahn and Sampson, where he taught participants how to cook Israeli vegetarian dishes.\n","Through those workshops, he has developed certain observations on the Germans' palate: \"The average German eater likes to try new things, but is scared of tastes that are too strong or too bold,\" he points out. \n","\"But once you show them how to do it, they fall in love with it,\" he adds. \"A lot of people were shocked to find out how amazing roasted eggplant can be or roasting pine nuts, which brings out all their flavor. Small things that anyone can do in their own kitchen,\" adds the foodie, who has also published a book of recipes and family stories about food, \"Ofirs Küche\" (Ofir's Kitchen), which came out in 2018.\n","Asked about his most notable culture shock experiences in Germany, the first thing that comes to his mind is also food-related: \"The taste of cucumbers and tomatoes,\" he humorously complains — a deception certainly shared by many Mediterraneans who are used to produce that ripens on the plants. \"But it's getting better,\" he adds.\n","Otherwise, he notes that he is still troubled by the discrepancies between the clichés about his adoptive country and how things actually work: \"We have this stereotype that in Germany everything is planned and on time, but then it takes 20 years to build an airport and the train never arrives on time.\"\n","Then, perhaps in an attempt to show that German quirks are not the only ones to drive him mad, he quickly adds that many other things drive him \"even more crazy,\" such as, in Israel, sitting in \"a bus across a soldier with an M-16 aimed at your crotch.\"\n","\"America\" will be screened on Sunday, September 9 at 6:30 p.m. at Moviemento, Berlin, and 7:30 p.m. in Kino 813 in Cologne.\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","\"150 years of Berlin's Victory Column: Changing symbolism 02.09.2023\"\n","There she stands, gleaming as on the first day: Victoria, the golden goddess of victory, enthroned on the Berlin Victory Column, which German emperor Wilhelm I inaugurated on September 2, 1873, after some eight years of construction. The court architect Heinrich Strack was responsible for the planning and construction of this \"National Monument to the Wars of Unification\"; the figure of Victoria with laurel wreath and Prussian eagle on the helmet was created by the sculptor Friedrich Drake.\n","After the wars against Denmark (1864), Austria (1866) and France (1870), which were called the \"Wars of German Unification,\" Wilhelm I, already King of Prussia since 1861, was proclaimed head of the German Empire in Versailles in 1871.\n","Wilhelm had already commissioned the construction of the Victory Column after the victory over Denmark in 1864.\n","The day of its unveiling marked the third anniversary of the French surrender — Sedan Day.\n","The Battle of Sedan took place during the Franco-Prussian War from September 1-2, 1870, which resulted in the capture of Emperor Napoleon II and his thousands of troops, effectively deciding the war in favor of Prussia.\n","At the time of its construction, the Victory Column stood about one and a half kilometers (about a mile) away from its current location on Königsplatz, now Platz der Republik.\n","It was erected on Siegesallee in front of the Raczynski Palace that housed the art collection of the Polish count and diplomat Atanazy Raczynski. The building was designed by the Victory Column architect Heinrich Strack. The palace was ultimately demolished, and, beginning in the mid-1880s, the new Reichstag building was erected and completed in 1894.\n","The Victory Column stood in the way of the plans of Nazi architect Albert Speer. For the \"World Capital Germania\" envisioned by the National Socialists, a huge congress hall was to be built in its place.\n","So, in 1939, \"Viktoria\" — who crowns the Victory Column — had to move to her present location at the Grosser Stern in the Tiergarten. There, the column was enlarged by another drum from just under 60 to now around 67 meters (197 to 220 feet).\n","Gilded cannon barrels that were taken from war booty, relief depictions symbolizing the grandeur and superiority of the Empire, and a goddess of victory that even the Nazis knew how to appropriate: no wonder the demolition of the Victory Column was up for debate after World War II. Polish soldiers, unaware of its significance, later regretted not having blown up the monument. The French occupation forces did request the demolition of the Victory Column, but the Americans and British voted against it, while the Soviet Union abstained.\n","Berliners quickly disbanded with the historical symbolism of the Victory Column, taking away a bit of the grandeur of the goddess of victory by giving it the nickname \"Goldelse\" (the equivalent of \"Golden Lizzy\"), which still persists in the vernacular.\n","Today, the monument is particularly popular with tourists.\n","But, that's no wonder, as the platform at a height of 51 meters offers an impressive panoramic view of the city. Along the Strasse des 17. Juni (Boulevard of June 17), one looks toward the Brandenburg Gate, which also showcases an image of Victoria, looking toward the east.\n","In 1987, German film director Wim Wenders sent Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander as guardian angels into the heaven over Berlin, in the film \"Wings of Desire.\" The Victory Column plays a central role, from which actor Bruno Ganz as the angel Damiel looks down on the then still divided city — and wants to throw himself down to become an earthly being.\n","Once the Berlin Wall collapsed, Wenders followed his film up with a sequel in 1993, \"In weiter Ferne, so nah!\" (\"Faraway, So Close!\")\n","Since the mid-1990s, the \"Goldelse\" has been in the midst of the hustle and bustle once a year: the Love Parade traditionally holds its final rally at the Grosser Stern in the Tiergarten, at the foot of the Victory Column. Its successor, Rave the Planet, and Christopher Street Day pride parade also pass by here. And, Barack Obama drew crowds here for a speech in 2008, shortly before he was elected US president.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic two years ago, the organizers — the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) — completely revamped the former auto show in an attempt to secure the survival of the fair as a \"globally unique mobility platform\" in a new location, namely Munich.\n","The IAA began in Berlin in 1897 and stayed there for 50 years before moving to Germany's financial hub of Frankfurt am Main.\n","Now in Munich for the second year in a row, the IAA wants to be seen as a showcase of \"urban mobility,\" exhibiting \"mobility ecosystems,\" and not merely a single mode of transportation, the automobile. The marketing pitch sounds like an excuse for the absence of many foreign automakers in Munich this year— indeed, more bicycle manufacturers are set to attend, whatever that says about the new IAA's appeal.\n","Quite naturally, the big three of the German automobile industry — Volkswagen (VW), BMW and Mercedes-Benz — have a vested interest in holding the event in their home market. But the list of globally known brands represented in Munich is shorter than ever, with, apart from the German heavyweights, only Renault from France and Stellantis Group's Opel brand.\n","A handful of exotic newcomers to the electric vehicle market like Lucid from the United States and Croatian electric sports car maker Rimac are also present. Vietnam's Vinfast EV company withdrew its participation at short notice, no reason given.\n","In the absence of the auto industry's big whales, some of the small fry are looking to create a splash on the European car market. One of them is BYD — initials stand for Build Your Dreams — a Chinese manufacturer based in the industrial hub of Shenzhen.\n","In China, BYD is an industry whale itself, especially with its battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) that are so successful that BYD last year replaced VW as Chinese market leader by sales. BYD is now building the dream of conquering the European market with its BEVs and plans to showcase six of its models at the IAA.\n","BYD used to be a manufacturer of smartphone batteries, but is now applying the know-how gathered in its early days to produce state-of-the-art batteries for EVs.\n","BYD car batteries do not require nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which makes them less expensive to produce. In terms of software and technical innovations, China's EV makers have also made big strides in recent years, and are now on the cutting edge of digital applications for cars.\n","China-made EVs are still few and far between on German roads — BYD has sold 1,448 cars so far, while VW has delivered 207,000 EVs in Germany. However, experts believe BYD and other Chinese EV makers will be able to win customers in Europe with significantly lower prices for their cars.\n","There is precedence: In the 1980s and 1990s, carmakers from Japan and South Korea were initially laughed at for their cars, but they then steadily increased their market share through lower prices and better quality.\n","\n","Despite the shortage of big names at this year's IAA, exhibition halls are 90% booked, according to the VDA industry group. IAA's design concept has been changed and now includes two separate locations — the main exhibition center for professional visitors and a so-called Open Space in downtown Munich for the general public.\n","BYD said it will showcase its cars at both locations. Perhaps it was this Chinese IAA dominance that made the organizers bend over backward to ensure the presence of the world's most valuable carmaker: Tesla. It is not known, however, why CEO Elon Musk has finally given in to VDA's courting, as Tesla usually prefers to organize its own special events to promote its technology.\n","Tesla, BYD and the German carmakers are currently locked in a fierce battle for bigger shares of the emerging EV market in Europe. After overcoming supply-chain snarls amid the COVID pandemic, German auto giants are back in expansion mode with surging sales and profits in the second quarter.\n","Auto experts predict challenging times ahead, however. \"China is well on its way to becoming an automotive superpower,\" said consulting firm AlixPartners in a note to investors recently, and added that the era of record profits for German manufacturers is \"coming to an end.\"\n","Consultants at EY also sense \"strong headwinds\" for legacy manufacturers in their home markets.\n","As far as the world's biggest car market China is concerned, more than one study predicts domestic manufacturers reigning supreme, with their market share surging to about 65% by 2030.\n","This article was originally published in German. \n","\"Hermitage Amsterdam cuts ties to Russia and rebrands as H'ART 01.09.2023\"\n","All visitors to Amsterdam who have taken a canal trip will be familiar with the building: It's a beautiful palace right on the River Amstel, a brick building with a striking white portal that was built in the 17th century as Diaconie Oude Vrouwen Huys, or \"Nursing Home for Old Women.\"\n","In the early 2000s, the building was rededicated as an institution for the arts. With support from the Dutch, a branch of the Saint Petersburg Hermitage, called Hermitage Amsterdam, was established here.\n","The elaborate renovation, which is said to have cost over €40 million ($43 million), was financed by Russia; officially, a private foundation registered in the United Kingdom at the time was behind the project.\n","Incidentally, this was not the first attempt by the famous Saint Petersburg museum to establish some sort of permanent representation in the West. There was already a branch in London from 2000 to 2007 and in Las Vegas from 2001 to 2008.\n","In 2009, Hermitage Amsterdam was officially opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Russia's then interim president, Dmitry Medvedev.\n","In the following years, more than a dozen lavishly staged exhibitions were held there, filled with pieces from the immense depots of Russia's Hermitage. With more than 3 million items, the museum is one of the largest and richest in the world.\n","Private treasures of the Russian tsars, antique gold, Persian miniatures and masterpieces by Caspar David Friedrich from the Russian collections were presented in Amsterdam — to name just a few high-profile projects.\n","Over 700,000 visitors saw the opening show. Numbers then leveled off at around 450,000 visitors per year. This put the museum securely in fifth place in the ranking of art museums in the tourist mecca of Amsterdam, overtaken only by the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh, Stedelijk and Amsterdam museums respectively. Admission costs €10 on average, so the investment certainly paid off even after deducting all incidental costs.\n","Of course, the business model of a museum empire with exhibitions that move from one branch to another is not new. The Louvre in Paris, for example, operates a successful branch in Abu Dhabi, and the Guggenheim museums are also a globally operating consortium.\n","On February 24, 2022 — the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine — the Hermitage was showing an exhibition of the so-called Russian avant-garde, which had opened shortly before.\n","Then, on March 3, the exhibition and the museum were closed.\n","According to Saint Petersburg insiders, the museum's pro-Putin Hermitage director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, convened a crisis meeting at the end of February, complaining among his close staff that he — as the \"museum prince of Russia\" — had not been informed of the plans for the invasion of Ukraine in time.\n","Amid the turmoil of launching the war on Ukraine, the Hermitage had to retrieve hundreds of invaluable artworks — not just from Amsterdam, but from elsewhere. These included two Titian masterpieces that were on loan in Italy as well as 23 pieces of the traveling exhibition \"Grand Tour. Dream of Italy from Venice to Pompeii.\"\n","The return transport of the famous Mozorov Collection from a Paris exhibition to various Russian museums also proved to be a major logistical and diplomatic problem, especially since some of the works also came from Ukrainian holdings.\n","While Russia's Hermitage staff was dealing with all of this, the Amsterdam branch was abandoned. But in a show of creative solidarity, the other art houses in Amsterdam came to its aid. Together they developed the idea of a Dutch Heritage museum as a transitional model.\n","First, the neighboring Rijksmuseum loaned one of its iconic works, Vermeer's \"Milkmaid.\" An exhibition on the history of the painting and the Delft painter's craft was arranged around the masterpiece. The exhibition also served as a successful introduction to the Vermeer mega-show in 2023.\n","Now Hermitage and the H'ART Museum have officially separated. Despite the circumstances, it looks like a clean break. As of September 1, the Amsterdam museum officially bears a new name, the H'ART Museum.\n","Both sides have engaged in an exchange of pleasantries: The Saint Petersburg Hermitage published an official statement on its homepage praising more than 15 years of joint success. Hermitage Director Piotrovsky regrets the separation imposed by politics and wishes the new project all the best \"in the care of the national cultural heritage.\"\n","Annabelle Birnie, the longtime director of Hermitage Amsterdam, is also quoted as saying that in the past decade and a half \"a brilliant museum has been created\" that inspired millions of people.\n","In a statement in the Russian press, she also expresses the hope that the bad times may soon be over, so that cooperation with the Saint Petersburg Hermitage can be resumed.\n","Until then, her house would \"bring art from all over the world to Amsterdam and present it in a new and unexpected way.\"\n","Three top-rate international players have been identified as new partners: the British Museum in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington.\n","This article was originally written in German. \n","'David Alabo: Afrofuturism and hope 30.08.2023'\n","The exhibition \"Surreal Futures,\" now on show at the Max Ernst Museum in Brühl, a German town just south of Cologne, features 31 artworks from 19 different countries.\n","The exhibition explores how surrealism can contribute to giving visibility to \"traumatized identities and bodies, as well as wounded landscapes,\" as the exhibition's accompanying text puts it.\n","In other words, \"Surreal Futures\" deals with nothing less than the major issues of our time, including climate change, environmental destruction, identity, colonialism and racism, reflecting artistic confrontations with these issues in a rapidly changing world.\n","The show, curated by Patrick Blümel, is divided into three thematic chapters: \"Digital Bodies,\" \"Transforming Landscapes\" and \"Future Worlds.\" \n","It is the museum's first exhibition with a digital focus, and it includes digital collages generated by 3D software, virtual reaIity and digital tools.\n","Works by Ghanaian-Moroccan artist David Alabo are also prominently featured in the show.\n","Alabo has been exploring many of the aforementioned themes in a multidisciplinary way for years and is one of the well-known representatives of Afrofuturism, a worldwide aesthetic movement that encompasses art, literature, music, film and science and that is created by African authors, mostly in the diaspora.\n","DW met David Alabo for a conversation on August 28, after the exhibition opening.\n","DW: What is your personal definition of Afrofuturism?\n","David Alabo: I love that question. I define Afrofuturism as a reimagination or reinterpretation of both futures and pasts that may have not existed or may have existed and there is a sense of hope or optimism you can get when you're imagining a future that you know isn't based necessarily on reality.\n","As an Afrofuturist, the main idea or driving force behind my work is to create a sense of optimism, hope and empowerment for people that see the work. African art has most of the time been quite drenched in pain and suffering, based on the history of colonialism and slavery, and a lot of these really real and serious topics.\n","And I think the job of an Afrofuturist specifically is to ask questions about how could we see our people? How could we see Black people? How could we see African people? How could we see people in the diaspora? Thriving in places that are imagined or surreal?\n","But I also like to have my art piece almost like a canvas for people's thoughts and expressions and for them to find some sense of healing through the art.\n","So, surrealism as healing instead of an escape into a dream world?\n","I'm not trying to remove the Black experience or my experience from reality, but I feel like when you look at the art and you meditate on it and you heal on it, it's a reflection of your reality seen through a different lens or seen through a different perspective, which I think is so important because a lot of the times we need a sense of healing, hope and optimism, because we do live in a world that's quite cynical, quite dystopian. We're always hearing news about the world's going to end.\n","So in a way, there's a fine line between creating a world that isn't based on reality, but at the same time allows people that experience my art or other Afrofuturist art to draw some sort of lessons to the world and bring and relate it back to their own existence.\n","You speak of a past that \"might have been.\" So, an imaginary past that we could strive for in the present?\n","I like to take the real symbols of Black power, Black resilience, like those common motifs of the raised fist, the Black Panther and also Black people. But I recontextualize them by putting them in new spaces, in new worlds that gives them a new meaning. Otherwise, I feel like the art would be a little too abstract.\n","When I create objects or sculptures, they're not necessarily based on things that I've seen before in my life.\n","I think I was drawn to surrealism because it allows me to tap into the subconscious, the unconscious and things that kind of pop up in my head. Art has been a great way for me to make sense of my own life and experiences, and I hope that that's what is transmitted through it when you see it.\n","There is indeed a renaissance of surrealism ...\n","It seems like the more we get into this tech-driven world, where we're being fed so much information about our reality, we want to see things that maybe don't exist.\n","I am using a lot of software and a lot of technology and at the same time, I am conscious of the fact that the people behind the technologies I'm using might not necessarily be Black or African. So, I think it's important as well for the Afrofuturist to ask questions about who is in charge of the technology or the structures that a lot of artists use.\n","In a way, it's as much about me consuming technology as it is about questioning it or trying to build. So I know the future for me is where I'm very much involved, not only in the consumption of technology, but also in its creation and development as a way to have more representation and a more equal amount of voices represented.\n","In the field of digital art, AI is also becoming an increasingly important topic. Where do you see the advantages and disadvantages of this technology?\n","We have models and programs that can turn out art on an incredible level and speed that is almost impossible for us to replicate as humans. But my point is that we should not be blinded by ignorance or to be afraid of it. I think that it's important for us artists to learn more about it — it doesn't mean you have to use it — but you can learn more about it just so you can be aware of how your place in this world might be shifting.\n","It's never going to replace what makes us human.\n","I use AI specifically for administrative things or for the things that take away time for me to create art, whether it's to answer emails or help me research something.\n","It doesn't have to necessarily be directly involved in my art, but it can allow me more time to be \"human.\" Especially after this show, when I met some of the people that use AI more directly, I realized that I'm just tapping the surface. There's so much I need to learn and I'm not in a rush because everybody's saying \"Oh yes, artists are gonna be done. Journalists are gonna be done.\" No, that's just fear mongering.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","What is your experience of the exhibition here?\n","I think it's beautiful that they've been so progressive in trying to show not only just futuristic or new media art, but also art from underrepresented communities. And it's very brave of the museum to not only host this, but to make sure that the artists are present. It's just as important as the people that make it be there than just the art.\n","The exhibition \"Surreal Futures\" is on show at the Max Ernst Museum in Brühl until January 28, 2024.\n","This interview has been edited for clarity.\n"," \n","'Venice film festival celebrates cinema despite Hollywood strikes 29.08.2023'\n","Three years ago, in August 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic in Europe, as we were all getting used to words like \"social distancing\" or the \"R\" reproduction rate, the Venice Film Festival defied the odds and held an in-person celebration of cinema.\n","It was an odd affair — temperature checks outside hotels, masking in the screening rooms — but it was a sign of hope for film fans. As movie houses were being shut and forecasters were predicting the death of the theatrical experience, the world's oldest film festival was still going, still showing the best new cinema in the world in dark rooms filled with (socially distanced) strangers collectively experiencing what the French call the seventh art.\n","COVID guidelines are gone for this year's Biennale, which runs from August 30 to September 9. The masks are off, there'll be no temperature checks and audiences in the Lido theaters will be packed in cheek by jowl.\n","But with both the Hollywood writers and actors on strike, Venice 2023, the festival's 80th anniversary, looks to be a similarly strange and hopeful affair.\n","The strikes mean many of the biggest films in Venice this year will arrive at the festival with no stars to walk the red carpet. That includes Netflix's \"Maestro,\" a biopic about the renowned Jewish conductor Leonard Bernstein directed by Bradley Cooper, his sophomore feature after the blockbuster success of \"A Star is Born,\" which premiered in Venice in 2018; David Fincher's new thriller \"The Killer,\" starring Michael Fassbender and Tilda Swinton; and \"Poor Things,\" the latest piece of period weirdness from Yorgos Lanthimos (\"The Favourite\"), starring Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo. \n","The unions — SAG-AFTRA for actors, WGA for writers — have forbidden their members from promoting any so-called \"struck productions,\" meaning movies made by a major studio or streaming service, the very people with which the guilds are fighting over a new contract. (Netflix produced \"Maestro\" and \"The Killer\"; Searchlight, a division of Disney, made \"Poor Things\").\n","\"Challengers,\" a menage-a-trois drama starring Zendaya from \"Call Me By Your Name\" director Luca Guadagnino, which was set to open Venice this year, pulled out due to the strike. Now, the movie won't come until sometime next year.\n","SAG-AFTRA has been handing out interim waivers to some independent productions to let them do promotion at Venice and attract attention from buyers to pick up their films.\n","So Adam Driver, who plays legendary Italian carmaker Enzo Ferrari in \"Ferrari,\" a new biopic by \"Heat\" director Michael Mann, is expected on the Lido. As are Priscilla Presley and Sophia Coppola, who will fly in for Coppola's drama \"Priscilla,\" which tells the story of Elvis' teenage bride from her perspective. Cailee Spaeny plays Priscilla, while Jacob Elordi portrays Elvis.\n","And there will be plenty of European stars punting around Venice. Mads Mikkelsen, last seen as a Nazi annoying Harrison Ford in \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" returns to his native Denmark for \"The Promised Land,\" a period romance from \"A Royal Affair\" director Nikolaj Arcel about the man who tried to tame the barren Danish heathland.\n","Caleb Landry Jones will be on hand for \"DogMan,\" a buzzy film billed as a potential comeback movie for out-of-favor director Luc Besson. Much of the cast of Roman Polanski's out-of-competition film, \"The Palace,\" including German star Oliver Masucci (\"Dark\"), Britain's John Cleese and French icon Fanny Ardant, are expected. However, the director, still a fugitive from US justice over a decades-old sexual assault case, is not.\n","Venice's decision to screen the new Polanski movie, alongside the latest from  Woody Allen, the French-language \"Coup de Chance,\" has been predictably controversial. Both men are triggering figures for many in the #MeToo movement and beyond. Expect calls for boycotts and even red-carpet protests when their films hit the Lido.\n","Looking past the strikes and the scandals, this year's Venice lineup could turn up some real gems. Italian art house maestro Matteo Garrone (\"Gomorrah\") is in competition with \"Io Capitano,\" a refugee drama that follows the journey of two young men from Dakar to Europe.\n","Polish directors Malgorzata Szumowska and Michal Englert return to Venice with \"Woman Of,\" a transgender love story sure to be a hot-button topic back home, where LGBTQ rights are under attack from the country's far-right government.\n","And \"Selma\" filmmaker Ava DuVernay makes history as the first Black female director in the Venice competition with \"Origin,\" a drama about the origins of the systems of racism and hierarchy that has shaped America.\n","There are some mainstream movies in the mix — Richard Linklater's action comedy \"Hit Man,\" Liam Neeson-starrer \"In the Land of Saints and Sinners\" — and art house purists will be rushing to see \"Evil Does Not Exist,\" the latest from \"Drive My Car\" director Ryusuke Hamaguchi; Wes Anderson's new short, \"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,\" based on a collection of stories from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" author Roald Dahl; and \"Aggro Dr1ft,\" an experimental, video-game-inspired film from \"Spring Breakers\" director Harmony Korine, featuring rap star Travis Scott and shot entirely in infrared.\n","Film fans will also say goodbye to the late, great William Friedkin, who died last month and whose final film, \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial,\" premieres in Venice this year.\n","At 80, the Biennale still looks spry, and while the red carpet star power might be a few watts dimmer this year, Venice offers a promising reminder that great movies are still getting made. When the strikes end, hopefully soon, film fans will be spoiled for choice.\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'Why the Goethe medal could spark political controversy 28.08.2023'\n","Georgian cinema professional Gaga Chkheidze will receive the official badge of honor from the German state this year, as will Taiwanese curator and dramaturg Yi-Wei Keng, and the OFF-Biennale curatorial collective from Hungary.\n","The award ceremony took place in Weimar on August 28, on the birthday of German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The president of the Goethe-Institut, Carola Lentz presented the cultural-political award during a ceremony.\n","This year's choice of prize-winners is likely to stir controversy, especially the selection of Gaga Chkheidze, from the former Eastern bloc country of Georgia.\n","Gaga Chkheidze, until recently director of the internationally renowned Tbilisi Film Festival, has fallen out of favor with the ruling Georgian Dream Party. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he publicly criticized Georgia for not immediately distancing itself from Russia.\n","That stance cost him his position as head of the Georgian National Film Center. In addition, he was expelled by the country's national film funding organization, the Georgian Filmfund.\n","The Tbilisi Film Festival's office on the site of the old Soviet film studios was closed, film grants were cancelled, and the festival's budget was cut.\n","Born in Georgia in 1957, Gaga Chkheidze has always been considered a friend of Germany and a \"cultural bridge builder,\" and not only between those two countries.\n","From 1976 to 1980, he studied in Jena, in the central German state of Thüringen. In the 1980s, he worked as the director of the German school in Tbilisi and taught German literature at the Georgian capital's Ilia State University. In 1988, he organized a Georgian film retrospective at the Arsenal cinema in Berlin, for which he smuggled films across the Soviet border in his car. In the 1990s, he was a translator and program coordinator for the International Forum of New Cinema at the Berlin International Film Festival, before launching the Tbilisi International Film Festival in Georgia in 2000.\n","\n","This coincided with the founding of a National Film Institute in Tbilisi, which gave Georgian films a new boost. The budget for film promotion was tripled, movie theaters sprung up, and more and more films made it to international festivals, from Berlin to Toronto. Georgian cinema drew attention from the European film market.\n","\"Gaga Chkheidze's commitment to film is crucial to Georgia's connection to European and international institutions and programs, film markets and festivals,\" the Goethe Medal award jury said in their citation.\n","Indeed, Chkheidze's festival concept appealed to both filmmakers and audiences alike. Soon the Tbilisi Film Festival became an international meeting place for filmmakers.\n","As director of the Georgian National Film Center, Chkheidze promoted the digitization and restoration of Soviet-era Georgian films. The preservation of the Georgian cinema heritage is another of Gaga Chkheidze's achievements. \n","But the Russian invasion of Ukraine also had an impact on Georgia. The Tbilisi festival came under increasing pressure, as demonstrated by the firing of its director.\n","\"Unfortunately, here in Georgia we are on the front line between democracy and autocracy,\" Chkheidze said in a recent interview with Deutschlandradio. There are many signs that political development in the country is heading in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"It's moving more toward authoritarianism — I don't want to say to dictatorship, but totalitarianism, we've already had that during the Soviet era. No one in Georgia wants that anymore.\" But the danger is real, he said.\n"," \n","Analysts say Georgia is indeed teetering between Moscow and Brussels. 15 years after its war with Russia, the country officially has aspirations of joining the European Union, which is offering the prospect of membership but still denying the country candidate status. \"Society is completely divided,\" the dpa news agency quotes Tbilisi sociologist Iago Kachkachishvili as saying. \"The majority wants to join the EU, but many hardly understand that the road is long.\"\n","The ruling Georgian Dream Party claims to be Russia-friendly. Its chairman, Irakli Kobachidze, emphasizes the high tourism revenue from Russians, the equivalent of about €900 million ($972 million) every year.\n","It is true that Georgia's government always appears pro-European to the outside world, says Kachkachishvili. \"But it's doing nothing to set itself on a course to EU membership; rather it's becoming more and more pro-Russian.\"\n","Two years ago, the documentary film \"Taming the Garden\" painted a picture of the situation in Georgian society. In it, Georgian director Salome Jashi tells the story of centuries-old trees that an influential man collects for his private park. \n","The man — presumably Georgia's ex-prime minister and party leader Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his billion-dollar fortune in the finance and commodities business — remains unnamed in the film. Jashi's theme is rather the uprooting of people, in both real and metaphorical terms.\n","\"Taming the Garden\" caused a sensation at film festivals around the world, including the 2021 Berlin International Film Festival. To this day, the film is not allowed to be screened in Georgian cinemas.\n","The Goethe Medal for Gaga Chkheidze arrives in the midst of this political tangle, Georgia's struggle for its course between Russia and the West. For the pro-Russian camp, the prestigious cultural-political award could be seen as an affront. To pro-Western factions, the award will be a sign of encouragement. In any case, the Goethe Medal is likely to cause a stir in Tbilisi.\n","Another Goethe Medal goes to Taiwan this year, with curator, playwright and translator Yi-Wei Keng being honored. He has brought important impulses to the Taiwanese theater scene, says the Goethe-Institut, including in the areas of experimental theater, children's theater and theater for people with disabilities.\n","\n","Under his direction, the Taipei Arts Festival has developed into the most important festival for performing arts in Taiwan. Guest performances and co-productions with Europe, the United States and Japan are cited. Yi-Wei Keng has also brought German theater productions to Taiwan, such as those by the Deutsches Theater Berlin, the group Rimini Protokoll and Raumlabor Berlin.\n","Yi-Wei Keng, born in 1969 in Taiwan, first studied philosophy. In Prague, he worked with non-verbal theater. Back in Taiwan, he began working in theater and as an author. Since 2012, he has been artistic director of the Taipei Arts Festival.\n","Finally, the third Goethe Medal honors the OFF-Biennial Budapest.\n","Founded in 2014 as the \"Garage Biennale,\" the art show sees itself as a grassroots movement to strengthen the local art scene in Hungary. Initially supported by a handful of art experts, the project has since developed into an independent platform for artists and art enthusiasts. \n","\n","The OFF-Biennial collective, consisting of six curators, rejects public subsidies as well as cooperation with state cultural institutions. Starting in its first year, the art show has attracted a lot of international attention.\n","With three editions to date — in 2015, 2017 and 2021 — it is now considered an internationally acclaimed event.

But I have to say that's a very provisional figure,\" Osborne said in an interview with BBC radio on Saturday.\n","\"We have started to recover some of the stolen items, which is a silver lining to a dark cloud,\" Osborne said.\n","The museum said the missing pieces include gold jewelry, semiprecious gems and glass dating from the 15th century BC to the 19th century AD.\n","The museum was first alerted to the missing items in 2021, when it was contacted by British-Danish art historian and dealer Ittai Gradel.\n","Gradel told The Associated Press that he noticed objects for sale on eBay that had reportedly belonged to a collection donated to the museum in 1814.

The archaeologist, now retired, was then a professor at the university in Halle — and curious about the well-preserved ancient work, which was considered a sensation.\n","The sculpture, a bust of Alexander the Great, was on loan from a private collector, it was said. For Lehmann, one thing mattered: was it a fake? \"I was there, I looked at it and I thought it was blatantly fake,\" he told DW. \"That this was an original was out of the question.\"\n","Alexander III of Macedon (born ca. 356 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of Ancient Greece. He spent most of his ruling years conducting an extensive military campaign throughout western Asia and Egypt. By the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history, ranging from Greece to India.\n","Lehmann searched the museum catalog for provenance information, but to no avail. He asked the museum point-blank but got no answers. He repeated his requests, unsuccessfully. \"Museums are never amused, that's clear, when important pieces on display in their main hall are called into question,\" he says.\n","That did not stop the archaeologist from continuing to call the sculpture a fake. Lehmann sees it as his duty to reveal the history of suspicious works. He fears that a rare find from antiquity might find its way into a museum catalog and thus be academically legitimized.\n","That's why, in 2015, he cataloged 36 ancient works of art that he believes to be fakes. Among them was the bronze statue of Alexander the Great. He also organized an exhibition on the subject at the Archaeological Museum of the University of Halle and called it: \"Long Ago in Stendal.\"\n","He also accused the museum of allowing itself to be misused as a \"laundry\" machine. The Winckelmann Society promptly sued him for libel. At the time, however, the court did not address the question that really interested Lehmann: Is the sculpture genuine?\n","But that would have been impossible, because immediately after the exhibition, the sculpture disappeared — it was considered lost for a long time. \n","Lehmann believed it was the heist of a well-made forgery of an international art dealer mafia. To detect something like this, you need decades of experience, a great deal of knowledge — and intuition.\n","Those skills helped Lehmann when a Swiss collector sent him the supposedly ancient bust of Emperor Augustus for examination. \"When you look at the details, you also have doubts as to whether this is really fake. It's perfectly done, after all. It's already masterful,\" he admitted to DW.\n","He had the sculpture scanned by computer tomography. Counterfeiters, as the assumption goes, have ancient coins melted down to cast new pieces from them. Theoretically, it's the perfect deception, because the material really is 2,000 years old. \n","But the depiction of Augustus did not stand up to scrutiny. Some criteria, such as the degree of corrosion, did not line up, so it could be proven that the item had been cast more recently.\n","Lehmann suspects the bust is from the counterfeiting workshop of someone known as the Spanish Master, who has yet to be identified. Whoever this person may be, they often create busts of ancient rulers and give them a beautiful patina. The facial features are always very well preserved, as though by magic. And of course, the counterfeiters create pieces that are currently in demand on the art and antiquities market.\n","\"Regarding the value of archeological objects, bronze statues are in the premiere category. They're something very special, and of course they draw the most attention,\" says Lehmann.\n","Whenever a find of this sort turns up, there's no shortage of people wanting to buy it. \"We're talking about money, money, and more money as the dominant factor,\" says Oscar White Muscarella, who for many years was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He has watched dealers funnel fakes into the market, like galleries and art fairs. But the main gateways are auction houses, according to Muscarella. \"At some point I realized that dealers in particular, but also collectors, were selling their fake objects at auction,\" he says.\n","\"I once talked to a dealer about it, and he just smiled. What they do is this: Instead of selling fakes in their own store, they put the objects up for auction under a false name, then say, 'This ancient artifact comes from an old collection,' they invent a provenance, a Monsieur X. That way, these dealers don't show up in person in front of the buyers.\"\n","The bronze bust of Alexander the Great comes from the New York art trade, from the gallery of Robin Symes. The Briton is considered one of the key figures in the illegal trade in ancient objects and has since gone into hiding. His company was liquidated, and the art objects stored in various countries were confiscated. So the bronze sculpture of Alexander the Great also found its way back to Greece, as one of 351 objects identified as looted art. Alexander is \"Number 11.\"\n","Stephan Lehmann learned about the issue from a Greek colleague who sent him a newspaper clipping with a photo. \"He just wrote, 'Can this be?' And I looked and saw a box, and packed inside was 'Alexander from Stendal.' The accompanying text said it was a piece from the art warehouse of the criminal Robin Symes in Geneva... And so it reappeared.\"  \n","It's clear the bust should not have been exhibited in Stendal without proof of origin, as Lehmann had demanded in 2000. He still considers it to be a fake but is pleased that it has been found again. After all, it could have been melted down, or be in the living room of a billionaire. \"But to turn up as a retransfer to a state, that's spectacular,\" Lehmann thinks.\n","Now, he hopes the material will be investigated. He assumes Athens is aware the bronze is suspected of being a forgery. After all, the Greek Minister of Culture herself holds a doctorate in archaeology. It is now up to the Greek state to investigate the provenance of the Alexander bronze. If it is genuine, it's worth many millions of euros. Or it could be worth only 100 euros, the value of its material. That, however, would be an inglorious end for Alexander the Great.\n","This article has been translated from German.\n","\"'Beyond Fame' — The art of the stars at Düsseldorf show 21.08.2023\"\n","For the exhibition \"Beyond Fame. The Art of the Stars\" at the NRW-Forum in Düsseldorf, curator Alain Bieber has selected artworks by 18 celebrities. On show are photos, paintings, drawings and sculptures. The mix of genres is as varied as the range of artistic personalities, which includes musicians, actors, writers, sports stars and politicans.\n","How did he come up with the idea for the show? \"We thought it was exciting to see all the people who were involved with art,\" Bieber told DW. He admits that, with celebrities, making visual art is often a marketing stunt. \"Ed Sheeran did an action painting once, and Britney Spears once did some flower paintings while wearing a bikini, he pointed out. For \"Beyond Fame,\" however, he says he chose people who take art seriously.\n","He says there are \"big surprises\" among them — works by German singer Tim Bendzko, for example, or even former tennis pro Michael Stich, that have never been shown in a museum before. \"You wouldn't think they'd paint like that.\" None of the selected artists had ever attended an art academy, he said. \"We want to leave judgment of the works to our audience,\" Bieber says. \"We're excited to see the reactions.\"\n","\"We cultivate Joseph Beuys' expanded concept of art here,\" explains Bieber, \"which asserts that everyone is an artist.\" One example, he says, is former Wimbledon champion Stich. After retiring from tennis, he took up painting as a hobby, studied art history for two semesters and set up a studio. Stich said it took him 10 years before he went public with his paintings. \"My art is a reflection of my personality and my emotions,\" as the exhibition organizers quote the former tennis pro.\n","The paths the selected personalities have taken to artistic expression are as varied as the people themselves are. And their choice of artistic medium is sometimes surprising. Some works are closely linked to their respective biographies. Some artists are at home in several creative fields at once. One of them is the German theater actress, author and visual artist Lea Drager. She draws images of popes, male and female, with which she questions patriarchal systems and hierarchical structures. Fellow German actress Meret Becker is active as a singer, actress and visual artist. Her work deals with social issues and she also campaigns for women's rights.\n","Musicians like Bryan Adams and Peter Doherty have sold millions of albums — and they've been creating visual art for many years. \"Good photographs are like time capsules that store memories,\" Adams told the Düsseldorf museum. Doherty, the scandal-ridden singer of British band The Libertines, sees art — along with poetry — as \"an expressive way to process his life.\" He works with blood and charcoal, combining drawing, painting, sculpture and collages of images and text.\n","The works by Canadian musician Claire Elise Boucher, aka Grimes, are populated by the kinds of fantasy figures — nymphs, cyborgs and manga characters — that she also portrays herself as in her music videos. According to the museum, she draws inspiration for her drawings and album covers from mythical and psychedelic images, borrowing figures and motifs from Art Nouveau and Surrealism, and has recently begun using artificial intelligence.\n","Whether as a counterbalance or a complement, people in politics also engage in artistic activities. For example, German Green Party politician Anton Hofreiter makes no secret of his enthusiasm for\n","nature. He earned a PhD in botany at the start of his political career, and he paints and draws flowers. For him, as the museum says, this is \"a way of recognizing how things really are.\"\n","\"Beyond Fame\" promises to arouse curiosity about little-known facets of prominent contemporaries. \"Some of our artists,\" promises curator Bieber, \"should soon be on view in other museums.\" For the time being, the artistic director of the NRW-Forum is banking on the \"Barbie\" effect: \"Whether you love Barbie or not — you simply have to have seen the latest movie!\"\n","The exhibition \"Beyond Fame.

He said that since the company Kino Bidco, a subsidiary of Cinespace, became the main stakeholder, there were hardly any films being produced in the historic studios. Schlöndorff, who has also served as the CEO of Studio Babelsberg in the past, warned that the studio could be wiped out of existence.\n","Earlier this week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke out in support of preserving Studio Babelsberg amid fears over the future of the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.

On this day in 1920, Polish soldiers and volunteers halted the Red Army's advance on Warsaw, changing the course of the Polish-Soviet War in the process.\n","In the months preceding this victory, Soviet troops had notched up several military successes and were on the cusp of capturing the capital of the Second Polish Republic.\n","The Soviets had hoped that the subjugation of Poland would be a milestone in a much bigger campaign: Leaders Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky had both wanted to reach Berlin \"over Poland's dead body.\" Once there, they intended to start a world revolution.\n","Poland's victory that day, which went down in history as the \"Miracle on the Vistula,\" put a stop to the Soviet march westwards.\n","Since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe more than 30 years ago, Poles have celebrated this historic victory. The Polish parliament declared August 15 Armed Forces Day in 1992.\n","Even though a military parade has been held on this day every year since 2007 — except during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic — this year's weapons display put all previous parades to shame.\n","On Tuesday afternoon, crowds gathered in the scorching summer sun to watch 2,000 soldiers and 200 military vehicles — including US-made Abrams tanks and South Korean K2 tanks — parade along the River Vistula and past Warsaw's Royal Castle.\n","The airspace over Warsaw was secured by Black Hawk helicopters and F-16 fighter jets. Soldiers from the US and a number of allied European countries marched alongside their Polish counterparts.\n","Addressing the troops and the crowds, Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said that it was \"a perfect day to show our strength, to show that we have built powerful armed forces that will effectively defend our borders without hesitation.\"\n","After the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Poland's government launched a massive program to modernize the country's army as quickly as possible. According to the Polish Defense Ministry, almost 140 billion Zloty (€31.5 billion/$34 billion) will be spent on weaponry this year alone.\n","The government will be cooperating not only with the US, which has long been an important partner, but also primarily with South Korea.\n","The close cooperation with Germany, which was an important partner for Poland in the years after the collapse of Communism, has deteriorated in recent years because the leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, views Berlin more as a threat than an ally.\n","All attempts to arrange a so-called \"ring exchange\" — whereby Poland would supply Ukraine with its old Soviet-designed tanks and get modern German Leopard tanks in return — ended last year with ill-feeling between the two neighboring counties. \n","Several years ago, Defense Minister Blaszczak made it clear that he wants Poland to have the biggest army in Europe. He recently announced that Poland now has more than 175,000 soldiers under arms. Experts estimate that of this number, only 125,000 are professional soldiers. The rest is made up of members of Poland's Territorial Defense Force and other volunteer formations.\n","Party leader Kaczynski on Monday also stressed the importance of a large army, saying that \"the Polish army must be increased to 300,000 soldiers. We have to buy very large amounts of weapons.\"\n","He also quoted the old Latin adage \"If you want peace, prepare for war.\"\n","But making Poland more secure is apparently not the only objective of this defense policy. The intention is plainly that the policy should also help the ruling PiS get re-elected on October 15.\n","Speaking in a televised debate on Sunday, Andrzej Zybertowicz, an advisor to President Andrzej Duda, openly admitted as much, saying that \"the military parade is intended to mobilize patriotic feelings, thereby helping the PiS in its election campaign.\"\n","Since last Friday, so-called \"military picnics\" have been taking place across Poland. In more than 70 locations around the country, soldiers have been meeting locals and tourists and showing off their state-of-the-art weapons.\n","Army recruitment officers were also on hand to generate interest in army careers among young people. State television later showed images of excited children in uniforms and helmets handling real weapons.\n","PiS politicians also attended the picnics, demonstratively showing themselves alongside soldiers and officers. There could be no doubt that they were campaigning, even though the Polish constitution expressly states that the country's armed forces must remain neutral in political matters.\n","Speaking on the Polish private television channel TVN, Retired General Boguslaw Pacek spoke of a \"monopolization of the army by [political] parties.\"\n","PiS accuses the opposition liberal Civic Platform (PO) under Donald Tusk of allowing Poland's armed forces to become run down during its time in power. It argues that between 2007 and 2015, many barracks were closed down and severe cuts were made to military spending.\n","What PiS politicians do not say, however, is that many Polish soldiers were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and that numerous armament projects — such as the procurement of the Patriot air defense system — were launched in this period. \n","Another topic that is inextricably linked to Polish security is the question of the Polish-Belarusian border, which is also becoming an election issue.\n","After the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was moved to Belarus, Poland announced that it was sending 10,000 soldiers to the border region.\n","The fence erected along the Polish–Belarusian border is proving to be more porous than intended: Despite the barbed wire, undocumented migrants succeed in entering Poland every day.\n","PiS accuses opposition leader Tusk of having opened Poland's borders for this kind of illegal immigration. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has referred to Tusk as \"the greatest threat to our security,\" while Kaczynski has said he is the \"greatest enemy of our nation\" and accused him of wanting to provoke a civil war in the country. \n","PiS would ideally like security to remain on the campaign agenda right up until election day in exactly two months' time.\n","In a further bid to improve its chances at the ballot box, the government will also be holding a referendum on a number of hot-button issues on election day. Polish voters will be asked, among other things, whether they \"support the removal of the barrier on the border between Poland and Belarus\" and whether they \"support the admission of thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa.\"\n","The opposition has warned that this is \"election manipulation\" and is calling for a boycott of the referendum.\n","Adapted from the German

The rotating sphere my father bought was made of plastic and could light up from the inside. Whether it was intended as a lamp or as an inspiration for a curious mind, mattered not. In any case, the globe as a lamp took away my fear of the dark hallway in the evening.\n","Sometimes, pointing at the globe, I would have my father show where we lived. He would point to a spot that was not surrounded by turquoise. Turquoise, I already knew that much, stood for the sea. \"And where does Mother Teresa live?\" At the time, I had a burning interest in where personalities of her ilk could be found.\n","But before all the countries and seas could be mapped correctly on globes, the world had to be explored, from the discoveries of seafarers from the 15th century to the dark side of the onset of colonization, all the while as the world seemed to get ever smaller.\n","Little did I know at the time that the world's oldest globe sat right here, in Germany.\n","But had I seen the globe produced by Martin Behaim at the end of the 15th century, I might have noticed a glaring absence: The continents of the Americas and Australia are nowhere to be seen, neither of which were known to central Europe at the time of its creation.\n","The globe, also known as the Erdapfel, now resides in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. Shortly after its completion, which has been dated somewhere between 1490 and 1492, the Italian-born Christopher Columbus became the first European to reach America, which marked the beginning of modern globalization. Australia was first reached by the British navigator James Cook and his crew in 1770.\n","\"What you can see clearly, and what is depicted very precisely, is central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean region and Africa. The further you go away from this region, the fuzzier it gets,\" says Sonja Missfeldt, press officer at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum.\n","This year, the globe was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World register as an outstanding testimony to how the world was imagined at the time.\n","For Jan Mokre, Head of Map Department and the Globe Museum of the Austrian National Library in Vienna, its listing as part of humanity's documentary heritage also represents an appreciation of the efforts of museums to preserve such valuable historical objects of cultural heritage, to have them professionally restored when necessary, and to make them accessible to visitors.\n","For Sonja Missfeldt, the Behaim Globe is a \"pioneering work of cartography.\" \n","It is made of various materials. The sphere, which is hollow on the inside, is covered with painted paper. A wrought iron frame holds the globe, which could originally be rotated, surrounded by a brass horizon ring.\n","Many people were involved in its making. Martin Behaim, who came from a patrician family in Nuremberg, had commissioned the globe. It is not quite clear why. It is possible that the specimen on display in the town hall at the time was intended to attract sponsors for global trade.\n","Behaim was himself a traveling merchant who is said to have participated in exploratory voyages along the coast of Africa in the 1480s.\n","In addition to land and water masses, the globe also contains information about foreign peoples, exotic animals and raw material deposits. Even places where goods such as spices could be extracted have been noted.\n","In addition, figures reminiscent of mythical creatures are depicted. Shadow-footed creatures, also called sciapods, are one example. According to Missfeldt, the depictions represent a widespread belief at the time, that there were people living in more remote regions in Africa who had only one leg and a large foot that stretched upwards.\n","\"The Behaim Globe is an object that stands, as it were, between the times. In terms of its image, it actually represents the medieval image that Europeans had of the earth, and does not yet point at all to the new era,\" explains Mokre.\n","It was created at a time in which the Europeans strove for supremacy in the world, by discovering unknown countries and parts of the world, where raw materials were plundered and inhabitants turned into slaves before being shipped across the world.\n","For the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, the globe \"reminds us of European conquests,\" while it is also \"a memorial to African slaves who played a decisive role in the creation of our modern world,\" says Mokre.\n","At the time of the Behaim Globe's creation, serial production was still a long way off. Spherical models of our world had existed since Greek antiquity, but the production of each individual globe was still a challenge for the craftsmen involved. \n","\"People didn't have any comparable systems to draw on, but started thinking about how to vividly represent the world in 3D,\" says Sonja Missfeldt of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum.\n","Today, the term globe is synonymous with a model of our earth. But there are also celestial globes and those of other planets and the moon.\n","\"Between 1520 or so and 1850, it was common to make terrestrial and celestial globes as a pair, to sell them as a pair, and to set them up as a pair. This dualism is very important because it is actually this interaction that represents the cosmos,\" explains globe expert Jan Mokre.\n","A very striking model that seeks to unite heaven and earth is the walk-in Gottorf Globe from the 17th century. It measures just under three meters (10 feet) in diameter and shows the Earth on the outside and the sky on the inside.\n","Driven by water power, this famous object, once made for a chamber of art and rarities, could rotate once around its own axis.\n","Earth and celestial globes in combination also exist in smaller form. In the 18th century, for example, pocket globes the size of billiard balls were popular collectors' items.\n","From about 1850, industrial production made the globe a mass-produced item.\n","And the practice of keeping a globe in private living and working environments started a bit earlier, says Jan Mokre, who dates it to the late 18th century. Among the factors that popularized ownership of the item was an improved educational situation and the fact \"that the economically strengthened middle classes wanted to represent themselves with knowledge.\" Globes, along with atlases and encyclopedias, were goods that could identify a citizen interested in education.\n","Anyone who would like to see a special model of our planet today has the opportunity to do so in the industrial monument Gasometer Oberhausen in Germany. There hangs a monumental sculpture of the Earth with a diameter of 20 meters. It is a globe of the digital age that is part of the exhibition \"The Fragile Paradise,\" which runs until November 26.\n","Visitors experience it from the space perspective of astronauts. Through satellite images projected onto it, they see not only the colors and continents of the Earth, but also the footprint that humans leave on it.\n"," \n","This article was originally written in German\n","'How teenagers from the Bronx invented hip-hop 50 years ago 11.08.2023'\n","In 1973, the Bronx in New York City was one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the United States. Robbery, muggings and murder were part of the residents' everyday life. Youths organized themselves into street gangs, taking control of their blocks and fighting each other.\n","The Bronx was on fire — literally. Firefighters regularly had to put out blazes in tenement blocks, as landlords used arson to speculate on insurance premiums.\n","The streets were littered with debris and junk; the neglected parks attracted drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. The entire neighborhood was crumbling, with many residential buildings empty and increasingly dilapidated.\n","As photojournalist Allan Tannenbaum wrote in an essay describing his personal experience of the area, in the early 1970s, the Bronx and other parts of New York City, such as the Lower East Side, Bedford-Stuyvesant or Harlem, looked like European cities after the Second World War.\n","There was great poverty, with a majority of residents living on welfare. Not because they didn't want to work, but because there was no employment at all.\n","Those who could afford it fled the neighborhood, but they also had to find a landlord who would rent them an apartment elsewhere. Although racial segregation was officially abolished in the US in the early 1970s, many white people did not want to live alongside African Americans, and continued to discriminate against them, making it difficult for Blacks to change their situation. Structural racism also contributed to the fact that it was predominantly African Americans and Latinos who stayed behind in the socially disadvantaged and neglected neighborhoods.\n","\"At the time New York city was almost bankrupt. There was really nothing there for kids to do,\" recalls Cindy Campell in a video produced by auction house Christie's, which is holding a special auction to mark the 50th anniversary of hip-hop's founding.\n","At the time, Campbell was in high school and, in order to be able to buy clothes for the new school year, she decided to throw a party. Admittance for boys was 50 cents, while girls paid 25 cents, according to the flyer for her \"DJ Kool Herc Party.\" \n","DJ Kool Herc was her 18-year-old brother, Clive Campbell.\n","So on August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc dragged his sound system, consisting of two turntables, a mixer, an amplifier and a set of speakers, into the community room of the tenement building at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx.\n","The smell of marijuana was in the air. The bass pumped and ripped through the sweating crowd as they danced and partied in the darkened room. DJ Herc's buddy Coke La Rock grabbed the microphone, greeted the guests and started rapping.\n","This later earned him a reputation as the first \"MC\" (Master of Ceremonies).\n","Around 50 people came, friends and young people from the neighborhood. They experienced the first hip-hop party in history — before terms like hip-hop or rap had even been coined.\n","DJing was nothing special, and rapping wasn't new either. US comedian Pigmeat Markham had already released a track, the single \"Here Comes the Judge,\" with rhythmic spoken word in 1968.\n","What was revolutionary about DJ Kool Herc's technique was that he created new tracks by using the instrumental parts of other songs, breaks with drums and bass. Since those lyrical breaks are often very short, DJ Kool Herc simply used a second copy of the same record on another turntable to lengthen the excerpts, by playing them back to back. He called this technique the \"merry-go-round,\" and thereby developed a new, extremely danceable sound made of breaks.\n","That's also where the term breakdancer comes from — referring to those who dance to the music generated from breaks.\n","DJ Kool Herc mixed different styles of music in his performances. He wouldn't reveal which records he was using, to make sure people would keep coming to his parties to hear his exclusive sound.\n","He inherited his passion for music from his father, who was an avid record collector and had jazz, gospel and country records at home. DJ Kool Herc was also interested in soul, as well as in modern disco music. He was always looking for sounds from which he could create a beat — the basis for a good hip-hop track.\n","The DJ had set off fireworks on the turntables, and word spread quickly around the Bronx. Everyone came to Herc's parties, recalls rapper Coke La Rock in the Netflix documentary series \"Hip-Hop Evolution\": murderers, thieves, dancers and normal people all came to the events, which ultimately moved to the streets and parks when the lounge became too small.\n","The block parties were a regular feature in New York City in the 1970s. Street lamps were often tapped to supply the music system with electricity.\n","In order to stand out as a DJ, you had to be loud, and DJ Kool Herc had the biggest and loudest speakers in the neighborhood.\n","Right from the start, hip-hop was not just a music genre, but an entire culture, encompassing DJing, rap, breakdance, graffiti and knowledge. It all came together at DJ Kool Herc's parties. Just one more reason the legendary party on Sedgwick Avenue is considered the birth of hip-hop.\n","Anyone who wanted to hear hip-hop had to come to the block parties, because in the mid-1970s hip-hop albums weren't available for sale, nor was the music on the radio.\n","It wasn't until 1979 that The Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\" became the first hip-hop song to make the US charts. It's a song that is now considered a classic, just like \"The Message\" by Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, which came out in 1982 and tells of life in the New York ghetto.\n","\"Hip hop has been the Voice of the Voiceless, the story of marginalized communities, where people can tell stories about the social inequities that are happening in communities, black and brown communities. Not just here in America but all around the world,\" said Rocky Bucano, director of the Universal Hip-Hop Museum in New York, in a promotional video for the museum's planned opening in 2024.\n","In a video of the web video series \"Black History in Two Minutes,\" filmmaker Ava DuVernay called hip-hop the \"CNN of the Black community,\" because it poetically reports on everything that Black people experience in everyday life.\n","Many US rappers who have made it to the top don't come from the middle class, but from the poor backgrounds where hip-hop originated.\n","Moving from subculture into the mainstream, hip-hop is now one of the most popular music genres in the world, with superstars including Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G., LL Cool J, Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys, the Wu-Tang Clan, Timbaland, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Nas, Eminem, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Drake, Missy Elliott, Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar, to name just a few.\n","From the United States, hip-hop culture has spread worldwide, influencing music, fashion, film, advertising and art.\n","In Germany, where a hip-hop scene with different trends has also developed over time, hip-hop is truly a political culture: In 2017, a hip-hop political party was even set up.

It was yet another disaster for a nation long marked by civil war, political crises and economic decline.\n","Many cultural sites were severely damaged by the explosion, including the Nicolas Ibrahim Sursock Museum, Lebanon's oldest independent cultural institution.\n","But after almost three years of restoration work — helped with over $3 million (€2.7 million) in support from France, Italy and UNESCO — the building was able to reopen in May 2023.\n","\"A miracle and a sign of hope,\" said Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, former president of the German Goethe Institute and the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, of the reopening. The Sursock Museum had for decades been an \"anchor for Lebanon's cultural scene and a showcase for the country's art production,\" he added.  \n","The explosion struck at the heart of cultural life in Beirut, which was once dubbed the \"Paris of the East.\" In the Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael neighborhoods, many cafes, alternative spaces for poetry slams or small live concerts, as well as design studios for jewelry, furniture or clothing, were destroyed.\n","But for Sursock Museum director Karina El Helou, the restoration of the institution has become a \"symbol for the continuity of cultural life in Beirut.\"\n","\"The explosion destroyed a great deal,\" recalls German-Lebanese art historian and gallery owner, Andree Sfeir-Semler. \"Many musicians lost their instruments; many painters their works of art.\"\n","Sfeir-Semler is a specialist in Arab contemporary art and runs — in addition to her gallery in Hamburg, Germany — an artistic branch in Beirut. Her exhibition rooms at the port were completely destroyed in the huge August 2020 explosion. Until today, it remains unclear who is responsible for the disaster.\n","\"Lebanon's art scene still exists, but it exists less and less in Lebanon,\" Lehmann says of a growing exodus of creative artists due in large part to economic crises and corruption.\n","\"Beirut's cultural scene is now spread all over the world,\" explained Anne Eberhard, director of Germany's Goethe Institute in Beirut.\n","Large diaspora communities have emerged in France and Germany in particular, she says, adding that \"Berlin is increasingly becoming a kind of Arab cultural capital.\"\n","In Beirut, meanwhile, many cultural institutions have given up or downsized as the economic divide between rich and poor in the country continues to grow, notes Eberhard — and where one in five people are a Syrian refugee.\n","Indeed, culture has long been impacted by both economic and political instability dating to when sectarian groups divided power among themselves after Lebanon's 15-year civil war. \n","\"Art and literature became increasingly politicized and ideologized,\" noted Klaus-Dieter Lehmann.\n","Despite these barriers, art and culture are once again playing a central role in Lebanese life as emerging artists perform on the streets, in refugee camps, or organize festivals in the provinces, Eberhard explains. \n","The Goethe Institute helps financially with such artistic projects, providing \"structural aid\" where there is a lack of state cultural funding. The Goethe program \"ArtEvolution,\" for example, supports young Lebanese artists in their own productions.\n","Artistic independence is vital to this cultural work.\n","\"Lebanon's contemporary art,\" said gallery owner Sfeir-Semler, \"is the only entity today that doesn't depend on one of the 18 religious communities in the country.\"\n","In Beirut, she says, a certain tolerance still exists. \"Why is there such an art scene in Lebanon and not in Syria, in Egypt, in the Gulf states?\" the art expert asks. \"Because there is no Arab city where people are as free as in Beirut.\"\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Giving further hope to Beirut's cultural life are plans to build the Beirut Museum of Art, or BeMA, by 2026 (see top photo).\n","To be located near the National Museum that preserves the country's archaeological treasures, and in the vicinity of the new Beit Beirut cultural center, BeMA could house the collection of the Lebanese Ministry of Culture.\n","The approximately 2,300 works of modern and contemporary art by predominantly Lebanese artists are currently still stored in depots and — according to newspaper reports — are in a miserable condition: holes in canvases, works covered in dust and mold, broken sculptures.

From Melbourne to Dublin via Amsterdam and Cologne, to name but a few, people attempt to recreate the dance moves from one of the two music videos made for the song, along with Bush's costume of red dress and tights, accented with a black scarf around her waist.\n","The fact that most of the people who take part in the event weren't even born when the song was released is testament to Bush's enduring appeal. That also got a huge boost last year, when her 1985 hit \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\" landed back in the charts again, thanks to being used in a pivotal scene in Season 4 of the hit Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" That led to a whole new generation discovering the legendary artist.\n","Kate Bush was just 19 years old when \"Wuthering Heights,\" inspired by the Emily Bronte novel of the same name, was released and became an immediate smash hit. Despite Bush's eclectic musical style and eccentric aesthetics, and her fondness for lyrics based on obscure or esoteric subjects, she landed hit after hit through the 1980s and into the '90s, before taking a 12-year break to focus on her family.\n","\n","Her innovative approach extended to technology, as she became the first musician to have a wireless headset microphone made for her.

And in 2014, she became the first woman to have eight albums in the UK charts at the same time. She remains hugely influential for many other artists, with Icelandic singer Björk calling her \"Mother\" earlier this month in Interview magazine. \n","Björk has also spoken critically of the sexist way the mainstream music media tended to write about Bush in past decades, dismissing her as a \"crazy witch\" in an interview with NME. That ignorance may have come from an inability to accept the very qualities that have made Kate Bush so beloved by her fans: a certain iconoclasm and a fierce adherence to her own artistic vision — and the fact that, as one fan put it in a New York Times article about an annual tribute event in Philadelphia, \"The tone of the show, like Kate's work, is a mix of deeply earnest and really, really silly.\"\n","That fusion of sincerity and lightheartedness also characterizes \"The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever,\" as Kate Bush fans everywhere celebrate this enigmatic and innovative artist.\n","Edited by: John Silk\n"," \n","'Germany and speed: An exhibition on a special relationship 29.07.2023'\n","Germany is synonymous with speed . From autobahns to automats (vending machines), Germans have no time to waste.\n","Even the language tells you they don't have time for excess: Verschlimmbesserung (which is when you try to improve something, with good intentions, but actually end up making it worse). Why use 16 words when one will do?\n","And in 1886 when Carl Benz applied for a patent for his \"vehicle powered by a gas engine,\" the German entrepreneur began a reputation that has only gathered pace since, with almost one million people employed within the car industry across Europe's largest economy.\n","Now, in all its forms, the concept of speed — or \"tempo\" in the German language — is being expanded upon via artworks in exhibitions running concurrently under the title \"Tempo. Tempo! Tempo?\" across three museums in central Germany.\n","\n","The perspectives are showcased through three different lenses at a contemporary art museum, a historical museum and a technical museum respectively, with each presenting overlapping, individual exhibitions on the topic of speed.\n","The exhibition was one year in the making, the spokesperson for the PS. Speicher Museum in Einbeck, Stephan Richter, told DW.\n","\"The inspiration came between the CEO of our museum — Lothar Meyer-Mertel — and the manager of the museum in Hannover — Professor Doctor Katja Lembke,\" Richter says. \"The two of them wanted to do an exhibition together, and with a third museum. Each museum looks at the topic of speed from their specific point of view. In PS Speicher we look at it from the technological side, the Kunst Museum in Derneburg from the art point of view, and the museum in Hannover from the viewpoint of archaeology and ethnology, with the history of speed and what it has meant for mankind.\"\n","Even the title has three viewpoints at its heart, with the use of the full stop, the exclamation mark and the question mark, illustrating the different angles of the exhibition, Richter explains.\n","Across the trilogy of exhibitions, speed is explored from both outside and inside the box. Meaning, cars and motorbikes, of course. A hare too. But also in art form, looking at evolutionary theory and new media, as the race from A to B shows no signs of easing up.\n","The Art Museum in the Derneburg Castle, for instance, is presenting contemporary works by artists in the fields of sculpture, painting, installation and new media, who explore the concept of speed from angles such as evolutionary theory and technology.\n","The Landesmuseum in Hannover, meanwhile, looks at speed from a perspective of natural and cultural history. Finally, the exhibition in Einbeck focuses mainly on technical aspects of speed.\n","Upon arrival in Einbeck, you are struck immediately by the \"eye-catching\" Lockheed F-104 Starfighter jet from the United States, which had the capability to reach twice the speed of sound.\n","Also on display is a Bugatti Veyron which in 2010 set a land speed record of 431, 072 km per hour (268 mph).\n","The German theme is apparent throughout the museum with the more obvious examples of a Volkswagen Nardo and a BMW motorcycle, to the more surprising example of what is believed to be the first speeding ticket issued in Germany.\n","\"It's just a piece of paper,\" Richter explains. \"But it's the oldest traffic ticket in Germany, a warning about speed from 1894. You can see it in our exhibition for the first time. In those days, there were no street signs or ways of measuring speed. But the vehicle drove nearly 30 kilometers per hour, so not really fast. But the story goes that it drove nearby a restaurant and caused the curtains to flutter, indicating that it was going too fast.\"\n","But the exhibitions are not exclusively about Germany's relationship with speed. Pictures of highways in California, artwork from Bahrain, a Shuttle Ejection Escape Suit from NASA, and a kangaroo from Australia, are all prominent features across the trio of displays, with even a reindeer sleigh from Lapland on display.\n","Tempo.

While many are keen to learn French and Spanish, given their prominence in today's society, students at secondary schools still have the option to learn Latin, even though its often referred to as a \"dead\" language given that there are no native speakers. We don't even know how it sounded because it died out long before its tones were ever recorded.\n","In Germany, interest in Latin has been declining nationwide. Whereas in 2008 more than 830,000 young people throughout Germany were still learning the Indo-European language at school, by 2021/22 that figure had dropped to 539,000. In comparison, French is almost three times as popular.\n","Professor Stefan Freund is chairman of the German Association of Classical Philologists (DAV), the professional association for Latin and Greek at schools and universities, and teaches Latin at the University of Wuppertal.\n","Deutsche Welle spoke to the professor about Latin and its future within German education.\n","DW: Is Latin a \"dead\" language?\n","SF: Latin is a living look into the past and into the functioning of language.\n","What is the argument for still learning Latin today?\n","Latin teaching imparts meta-competencies that can be applied throughout life to dealing with and learning other foreign languages, and in substance do not become obsolete. While modern foreign language instruction focuses on communication, Latin instruction focuses on language reflection, such as how it is different from German, how a sentence works, how words changed, and how certain statements are formulated in certain situations.\n","And, of course, Latin is the common mother of the Romance language family (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian) and the origin of numerous English words, for instance language, computer and artificial intelligence.\n","Do students choose Latin instead of, for example, French or Spanish, at the insistence of their parents, or because they already have a particular field of study in mind?\n","One can only speculate about the students' motives. Four points are likely to be relevant: A general interest in history and mythology and an approach to language more through reflection and analysis than through direct communication. In addition, a study or career perspective for which Latin seems useful and the teachers, who are on average quite young, know how critically the public, parents and the students view their subject and therefore attach great importance to appealing teaching that has nothing to do with the selective drill from the cliche images.\n","For which courses of study and professions in Germany is Latin useful or even a prerequisite?\n","What Latin is required for varies. It tends to happen less frequently than it used to. In any case, it is useful for many subjects: History, philosophy, theology, Roman studies, law (Roman law), medicine (history of medicine, terminology), pharmacy (terminology), linguistics, all disciplines that deal with the time before about 1750 and the European area... History of Music, History of Art, History of Science, Church history, local history.\n","Latin died out around the 7th or 8th century but when did its significance wane?\n","Until the 18th century, Latin was the most common language in which newly published books were printed. Huge stores of knowledge on all sorts of issues are accessible thanks to my knowledge of Latin, since only a tiny part of this neo-Latin text is translated.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","You can find even more content about Germans and their traditions, everyday culture and by following Meet the Germans on Instagram,YouTube and check out the website www.dw.com/MeetTheGermans\n","\n"," \n","'Czech tycoon Kretinsky eyes German steel and big subsidies 28.07.2023'\n","The energy crisis helped the owner of Czech energy holding Energeticky Prumyslovy (EPH) post a record profit ­­of €4.6 billion ($5.09 billion) in 2022. Reports suggest that the Czech billionaire might use those funds to buy the steel unit of Germany's industrial giant ThyssenKrupp.\n","That has many, not for the first time, asking: who is Kretinsky, anyways?\n","On the surface, at least, the taciturn 48-year-old seems a contrast to the older, rather gruff and arrogant generation of Czech oligarchs that emerged in the post-communist years.\n","Suave and cosmopolitan, on the rare occasions he talks to the media Kretinsky likes to focus on his art collection, and do so while sipping green tea.\n","Acquisitions across Europe have given him an international profile the likes of which few Central European business magnates have achieved.\n","Jerome Lefilliatre, a media and business reporter who wrote a biography of Kretinsky in 2019, described him as \"extremely intelligent, very ambitious, very determined, and very opportunistic — the perfect businessman,\" in an interview for French daily Le Monde in 2020.\n","But there is suspicion that Kretinsky's remarkable — and largely unexplained — rise to Czechia's second-richest person with a fortune of $9.4 billion (€8.49 billion), in fact relied heavily on the same networks as those earlier, unreconstructed tycoons.\n","Indeed, looking closer, the mask can slip, with the billionaire's words often at odds with his actions.\n","\"To the extent that our results were due to the Russian invasion, I do not celebrate them,\" Kretinsky told the Czech edition of Forbes Magazine in April as he discussed EPH's bumper year.\"\n","At its core, Kretinsky's empire, which has an estimated value of over €9 billion, is also deeply old fashioned. EPH is built on coal and a simple bet against Europe's energy transition.\n","When Slovak oligarch group J&T and PPF — an investment vehicle owned by Czech oligarch Petr Kellner before he died in 2021 — founded EPH in 2009, Kretinsky became chairman and a 20% shareholder, pitching him into partnership with the top privatization barons of the post-communist era.\n","By 2014 he had full control and was building out EPH using Slovak pipeline operator Eustream — then the main carrier of Russian gas imports to Europe — as a cash cow on which he could leverage debt.\n","A feverish acquisition drive followed, as cut-price coal-based assets were bought from European energy giants keen to clean up their portfolios.\n","A key deal was the 2016 capture by LEAG — a partnership with PPF — of a German lignite mine and power plants from Swedish state giant Vattenfall.\n","But the real kicker was Germany's decision to phase out coal from power production by 2038. The government in Berlin has agreed to pay €1.75 billion to have LEAG shutter four power plants slightly ahead of schedule, with further payments for other units to be kept as a back-up during the switch to renewable energy.\n","Now Germany's second-largest coal miner, EPH has gone on to buy ageing coal-based assets in seven other European countries, and controls strategic portions of the national networks of Italy and the UK.\n","\"Most investors need to stress some sort of long-term horizon, but Kretinsky ditched that idea,\" says Jan Osicka from Masaryk University in Brno, Kretinsky's home town. \"With hindsight there was clearly space for someone to make this bet on slower decarbonisation. The key for EPH was the scale,\" he told DW\n","However, Kretinsky hasn't kept all his eggs in one basket, spending recent years shopping enthusiastically in Western Europe.\n","Significant stakes have been acquired in supermarket chains in the UK, France and Germany. On Friday, embattled French retail giant Casino said Kretinsky was one of two candidates in the running to buy the debt-laden grocery chain. Stakes have also been taken in postal services in the UK and Netherlands.\n","Having previously joined a trend that sees the Czech media landscape being bought out by oligarchs seeking political clout, Kretinsky has sought to replicate the trick in France. But journalists at Le Monde blocked his attempt to secure control of France's newspaper of record, proclaiming commitment to an independent press.\n","In addition, Ukraine labelled German wholesale giant Metro a sponsor of war, claiming that \"key shareholder [Kretinsky]… is closely linked to the oil, gas and banking sectors of Russia's economy.\"\n","\n","Following these adventures, ThyssenKrupp Steel looks like a deal straight out of Kretinsky's old playbook.\n","An EPH spokesman failed to respond when asked if the billionaire is interested, but the carbon-heavy industrial giant is unlikely to be expensive. ThyssenKrupp has been trying to offload its steel business for some months — and it looks set for a subsidies bonanza.\n","Following huge worker protests, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck promised in June to do whatever it takes to help decarbonize the steel industry in order to preserve it. Berlin has readied €2 billion in support for a planned \"green\" steel plant running on hydrogen.   \n","In that climate, Kretinsky may fancy his chances of securing further support to keep the presses running, while EPH's nearby coal assets would likely happily supply energy.\n","\"Kretinsky's assumption that government's would have to keep his energy assets afloat turned out correct, and you could make similar assumptions regarding ThyssenKrupp,\" said Osicka. \"The German government has made it clear it won't allow these key industries to fall, and it's guaranteed that huge sums will be pumped into modernization.\" \n","Edited by: Uwe Hessler\n","While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The aim was to save and protect foreign culture from destruction during the Russian war. The renewed Russian attack on the port city has caused great indignation at UNESCO. In an interview with DW, Lutz Möller, deputy secretary general of the German UNESCO commission, stresses that the sites are of \"universal significance.\"\n","In the buffer zone in the Old Town, which is supposed to be protected, several museums were attacked and damaged. He said that the Archaeological Museum, the Maritime Museum and the Literary Museum were especially affected. \n","\"The Archaeological Museum and the Literature Museum are right next to each other, while the Maritime Museum is located at the harbor,\" Möller said, adding that all three suffered damage. \"Unfortunately, we don't yet have comprehensive knowledge of whether the collection they hold are lost forever, because the inventory has not yet been completed.\" Möller does not believe that museum employees were injured or killed.\n","\n","Other cultural sites on the outskirts of the Old City, such as the Transfiguration Cathedral, founded in 1794, are also said to have been damaged. Images of collapsed domes and roofs, as well as a destroyed altar and icons inside, have been circulating online.\n","\"You don't have to be an expert to see that the structural integrity of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is severely compromised,\" Möller said. The Transfiguration Cathedral had already been destroyed in 1936 on Joseph Stalin's orders and rebuilt in 1999 as close to the original as possible. Catherine the Great, founder of Odesa, once ordered the church to be built and dedicated it to the Transfiguration of Christ. The church was visited by the Russian Patriarch Kirill as recently as 2010.\n","The attack on Odesa is the second time that a world heritage city has been shelled during Russia's war on Ukraine. Just two weeks ago, Lviv was hit by missiles.\n","\"It is an obligation not only for Ukraine to preserve these sites, but for the whole world,” Möller emphasized. \"UNESCO protects them not only because of the importance for the national identity of Ukraine. Indeed, the sites exceed the significance of a single state.\"\n","\n","Several thousand monuments considered significant from UNESCO's and Ukraine's point of view have been marked with a white and blue shield for the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts. \"We would like to secure these sites with the white and blue shield so that they are not shelled,\" Möller said.\n","Since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, 270 incidents causing damage to Ukrainian cultural sites have been recorded, as well as to 3,500 educational institutions, such as schools or libraries.\n","UNESCO has pledged support either in the form of personnel or financial assistance for reconstruction, the UN cultural body says.\n","\"One possibility is that reconstruction is done under the coordination of UNESCO, depending on the degree of damage. It may also be enough to raise money to help Ukraine rebuild,\" Möller said.\n","The latest attack on culture in Odesa coincides with the destruction of the Cultural Center for Folk Art and Art Education in the city of Mykolaiv, just over 100 kilometers (62 miles) away.\n","\n","German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said that Russia's \"targeted attacks on the museums in Odesa show once again this war is an attack on all areas of Ukrainian society and democracy,\" with a particular focus on \"their independent culture.\"\n","In addition, by bombing the World Heritage Old Town of Odesa, Russia is \"directly attacking a significant part of the cultural heritage of humanity,\" Roth continued. \"This criminal violence against the people of Ukraine, as well as their cultural assets, must end and be stopped immediately by Russia.\"\n","She added that the German government continues to stand firmly by the people of Ukraine and their culture.\n","This article was originally written in German, with additional information from news agencies. \n","\"Hitler's cultural accomplices: Wagner, Speer and Bechstein 22.07.2023\"\n","German publisher Hugo Bruckmann and his wife, Elsa, were among the early and highly influential promoters of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. They first officially invited him to their estate in 1924. Their \"literary salon,\" where intellectuals of various religions and opinions had met for intellectual exchange before World War I, was frequented in the 1920s primarily by German nationalists who railed against democracy and the Weimar Republic.\n","Among them was Hitler's later star architect, Albert Speer, but also the married couple Winifred and Siegfried Wagner, who organized the famous Bayreuth Festival in celebration of German composer Richard Wagner. Elsa Bruckmann provided a forum for all those who mourned Germany's imperial era and suffered from the economic crisis or the \"ignominy\" of the lost First World War.\n","\"The longing for a messiah was great, and the hopes of the upper middle classes were pinned on Hitler,\" explains Sven Friedrich, director of the Richard Wagner Museum in Bayreuth. Hitler had inspired Elsa Bruckmann and many others with his indoctrinating speeches and his visions of a new great Germany. The couple provided financial support to the leader of the National Socialist Party (NSDAP), and Elsa Bruckmann took pleasure in dressing him appropriately. Through her, Hitler also established crucial connections with prominent industrialists.\n","Adolf Hitler felt comfortable in these circles. \"After all, he had not received any significant education and had barely managed to make a living as an art and postcard painter in Vienna. He lacked a proper upbringing and background; he had to acquire everything on his own,\" Sven Friedrich elaborates.\n","Winifred Wagner, the daughter-in-law of composer Richard Wagner, was also one of Hitler's supporters. \"Winifred was enthralled by Hitler due to his sense of mission and his profound admiration for Wagner's music,\" says Friedrich. From the very beginning, he had promised her that he would take care of the Bayreuth Festival once he had power in Germany.\n","A friendship quickly developed between the two. At times, Adolf Hitler lived with the Wagners at their estate. A prominent member of the family was also Houston Stewart Chamberlain, an influential British-German race theorist, antisemite and a mastermind of the National Socialist movement. He was married to Richard Wagner's daughter, Eva. \"For Hitler, Chamberlain was an idol,\" says Friedrich.\n","In 1923, the National Socialists, led by Adolf Hitler, made an unsuccessful attempt to violently overthrow the government of the Weimar Republic in Munich. As a consequence of this failed coup, Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison. He began serving his sentence in the spring of 1924 at Landsberg Fortress and was granted early release later the same year.\n","\"This imprisonment at Landsberg Fortress was more of a house arrest, where one lived comfortably with like-minded comrades,\" Friedrich points out. The Wagners are not to be found on the visitors' list, but they kept up a lively correspondence with Hitler. Winifred Wagner sent him sweets and writing paper. It was on this paper that Hitler wrote his book \"Mein Kampf.\" Elsa Bruckmann later offered to be the editor for the second edition.\n","Alongside Elsa Bruckmann, the names of Helene and Edwin Bechstein are also on the list of Hitler's visitors in prison. The Bechstein piano company, founded in 1853 by Carl Bechstein, was a well-established German business at the time, and is still one of the biggest piano manufacturers today. \"Until the war, most prominent pianists played on a Bechstein piano or grand piano,\" says Gregor Willmes, a musicologist and cultural manager at the Bechstein company. Inflation in the 1920s hit the company hard.\n","Edwin, one of Carl's sons, had cashed out early on and had some wealth. He and his wife supported Hitler's plans, and like the Wagners, they also hosted Hitler in their villa.\n","Once Adolf Hitler gained power, the Bayreuth Festival was under his personal protection because the Wagners had always supported him. \"He reciprocated by granting Bayreuth substantial financial subsidies,\" says museum director Sven Friedrich. The National Socialists ensured that the performances, known as the \"War Festival Performances,\" continued until 1944.\n","With the start of World War II, Hitler's visits to the upper-class ladies became less frequent. Elsa Bruckmann distanced herself from Hitler because of the atrocities committed on his orders in the persecution of the Jews and in the war. However, she is said to have retained her nationalist sentiments until her death in 1951.\n","Winifred Wagner remained an ardent supporter of Hitler and National Socialism after the war. She — like her son Wieland, who had stood closely by Hitler's side — had to go through a so-called denazification procedure. She was not allowed to continue in her position as festival director in Bayreuth. She continued to meet with acquaintances from the Nazi era.\n","Hitler's architect Albert Speer was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Other cultural figures, like sculptor Arno Breker, or conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Herbert von Karajan, had cooperated with Hitler, but the Allies eventually classified them as \"fellow travelers\" (\"Mitläufer\") and they were able to resume their activities successfully after a time. Breker even created works commissioned by the German government after the war. And conductor Friedrich Furtwängler was celebrated during his tours with the Berlin Philharmonic in Europe. Wieland Wagner, on the other hand, took over management of the Bayreuth Festival together with his brother Wolfgang. They introduced a new aesthetic with lighting effects and sparse stage designs, and Wieland was hailed as a great innovator in stage direction.\n","Helene and Edwin Bechstein's closeness with Hitler had also damaged the reputation of the piano making company after the war. Nevertheless, they kept the name. \"We carry the name, of course, because of Carl Bechstein, who was an important personality and promoted art and culture, but we are aware of this inglorious history surrounding Helene and Edwin,\" says cultural manager Gregor Willmes. Today, the company works with many Jewish and Palestinian pianists from Israel and supports musical projects that deal with National Socialism.

However, presiding Judge Bettina Brückner acknowledged that the collector was in a \"predicament\" as the painting would likely be difficult to sell. According to the ruling, the interests of former owners or their legal successors and the general public's interest outweighed the current owner's interest when it comes to cultural property possibly confiscated by the Nazis.\n","The plaintiff could choose to attempt legal action in an administrative court against the operator of the Lost Art Database, the German Center for Lost Cultural Property, the presiding judge in Karlsruhe said. The court did not publish the plaintiff's name.\n","Previously, the man had sued the trustees of a Canadian foundation that had commissioned the search for his artwork, \"Calabrian Coast — Sicilia,\" by the painter Andreas Achenbach (1815-1910).\n","\n","The painting's provenance is clear: from 1931 to 1937, it belonged to the Jewish art dealer Max Stern, who ran a gallery in Düsseldorf founded by his father. Stern was banned from carrying out his profession in 1935 by the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts, but the order was not initially enforced. In 1937, Stern sold the Achenbach painting to a private individual from Essen. In September 1937, he was forced to give up his gallery, and he emigrated two months later via England to Canada, where he died in 1987. A Canadian trust currently administers his estate. \n","\n","The plaintiff had bought the painting at auction in London in 1999, which meant there was no doubt about his rightful ownership. While the work was on exhibition in Baden-Baden in 2016, he learned that it was listed in the Lost Art Database and was being sought by Interpol. \n","A settlement between the current owner and the Canadian trust that administered Max Stern's estate fell through. In court, the collector wanted the trustees to stop claiming ownership of the painting. He also wanted the search notice removed. The man indicated he did not want any further criticism of his property. He had previously also failed to have the entry deleted in lower courts.\n","The Lost Art Database is a publicly-accessible database set up by the German Lost Art Foundation to keep track of artworks looted or expropriated by the Nazis.\n","The German Center for Lost Cultural Property said it would await the detailed written justification for the ruling before considering any need for action. But it welcomed the ruling itself, and said that, by operating the database, the Center was contributing to Germany's obligation to come to terms with Nazi injustice. \n","los/sms (dpa, AFP, AP)\n","While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Likewise, bars and restaurants playing Russian background music may end up getting in trouble.\n","The reason is that Kyiv city council has issued a temporary ban on performing or showcasing Russian-language art and culture — such as books, music, plays and concerts — in public. This ban also encompasses cultural and educational programs. The restriction not only applies to works by Russian authors and creators, but to all cultural products publicly presented in or translated into Russian.\n","Ukrainian MPs said the move was designed to protect Ukraine from Russian influence. \"Russia is the language of the aggressor and it has no place in the heart of our capital,\" said Vadym Vasylchuk, the deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Education and Science, Youth and Sports.\n","The move is backed by Ukraine's Vidsich (Defense) movement, which began calling for a ban on the Russian language and Russian goods, films and music in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea. \"A ban on Russian-language cultural products is necessary,\" Vidsich activist Kateryna Chepura told DW. \"This is an additional lever for activists working to boycott everything Russian, so we can say: shut it down, remove Russian from public life.\"\n","The Kyiv city council ban, however, is temporary, lending it a symbolic quality only. A permanent, legally binding ban would require support from Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada.\n","As a result, Chepura calls Kyiv's temporary ban \"an ineffective instrument, because you cannot be held accountable for disregarding it.\" She regards it as a \"moral factor encouraging people who do not want to continue tolerating Russian music on the streets or in theater.\"\n","In fact, certain Russian-language cultural products are already prohibited in Ukraine. The bans date back to September 2019, when the first restrictions were imposed in the region of Lviv. Subsequently, other cities like Ternopil and Zhytomyr in the Volhynia region, followed suit.\n","Human rights activist Volodymyr Yavorskyy of the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties, however, said such bans are discriminatory and unconstitutional. \"These are illegal decisions, because local authorities have no right to regulate such issues and impose such bans,\" Yavorskyy told DW. \"That is why they have no legal consequences.\" The judiciary, he added, had already deemed such local bans illegal.\n","A person violating the Kyiv city council moratorium on Russian cultural products cannot be held accountable, Yaworskyy said. \"These bans issued by local authorities are nothing but political gestures — only the Ukrainian parliament can turn such bans into law.\" Only then, he said, would they become legally binding and enforceable.\n","In June 2022, the Ukrainian parliament already banned publicly playing songs by Russian artists. The restriction does not, however, apply to Russian singers who condemn Russia's war against Ukraine. Recently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed a law banning the import and distribution of Russian books. It was passed by parliament last year.\n","Regardless of whether or not local bans are in place, playing Russian music in public is bound to cause controversy. Take, for instance, a recent disagreement between a 17-year-old busker and Ukrainian MP Natalya Pipa. She complained when the teenager performed songs by Russian rock legend Viktor Tsoi on the street in Lviv, who in return insulted the woman, saying he was allowed to play whatever music he liked. Later, however, the busker published a video in which he apologized to the lawmaker.\n","Another altercation occurred in the village of Pohreby, in the Kyiv region. There, a young woman was thrown out of a cafe for complaining that the establishment was playing a song by Russian pop singer Grigory Leps supporting Russia's war against Ukraine.\n","Yevgenia Belorusets, a Ukrainian artist, translator and author who works in Ukrainian Russian and German, says the Russian-language ban is discriminatory. \"These bans perpetuate the myth that Ukrainian culture is always being discriminated against,\" she told DW. \"This then supposedly gives it the right to discriminate against other forms of cultural expression.\"\n","\"Ukrainian-language culture knows too well how discrimination feels,\" she added. \"It should not try to overcome this trauma by inflicting similar pain on others.\" The creator said Ukraine should not mirror Russian aggressors and refrain from \"projecting Russia's aggressive intentions onto Ukraine's complex cultural situation.\"\n","Belorusets said language bans could divide Ukrainian society, warning that \"it's getting harder and harder to talk about this in Ukraine, because doing so is immediately labeled as a hostile act.\" Ukraine's future as a democratic state, she said, depends on granting everyone their rights and accepting their own complicated past. \"The challenge consists in accepting competing views within society.\"\n","This article was translated from German.\n"," \n","\"Myanmar's artists and the forgotten civil war 20.07.2023\"\n","The oil painting that opens the exhibition has a spectacular journey behind it: rolled up and disguised as hand luggage, it was recently smuggled out of Myanmar. Titled \"Bitch better have my democracy,\" it's a striking and colorful work by artist Richie Htet, who painted it soon after Myanmar's military coup in February 2021. \"I wanted to encourage us at that time. There were a lot of images of the atrocities circulating on the Internet. I wanted to create something triumphant,\" Htet tells DW. When he posted it on social media, the image immediately went viral.\n","Today, the painting is considered an icon of courageous protests against the military dictatorship that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of people and forced some 1.5 million to flee the country. Htet's painting shows the dark-haired beauty Mie Bamar Pyi, a personification of Myanmar, bearing a shield in one hand and a spear in the other. She attacks an Ogre, a demon from Buddhist mythology, who is dressed as a general from Myanmar's military junta. The motif references both Asian and Western icons: it quotes the battle of the Hindu goddess Durga against a demon, while also calling to mind Christian depictions of the Archangel Michael defeating Satan.\n","For painter Richie Htet, the work represents the collective effort of Myanmar's people to fight the military junta. So for Li Li, co-organizer of the exhibition, \"We Are the Seeds: The Art of Myanmar's Spring Revolution,\" it's a small miracle that this painting can be seen until July 21 at the Open Society Foundation in Berlin. \"If the painting had to be rolled out at airport security when it left the country, our contact probably would have ended up in jail,\" Li Li tells DW.\n","The exhibition includes works by 18 Myanmar artists, most of whom live in exile in Paris, like co-organizer Li Li and Richie Htet. With the wide-ranging show featuring paintings, installations, sound and video, Li Li wants to draw attention to the civil war that has largely been forgotten in Europe. \"The military already had experience; this is now the third coup. From the past, they knew about the power that can come from artists during protests. That's why they were and are particularly vulnerable.\"\n","The 29-year-old Htet is considered a promising painter in Myanmar's contemporary art scene, which gained international attention following the democratization of the country in 2011. He grew up under the military dictatorship and outed himself as gay at just 14 years old — an act of bravery, since homosexuality, while not illegal in Myanmar, is considered \"unnatural\" in the country. After studying in London, Htet returned to Yangon, where he became the art director of a fashion magazine.\n","It was a time of awakening and sheer unbridled creativity. Htet began to paint homoerotic images that played with Indian and South Asian mythologies, which, from his point of view, are rich in queer characters. In his first solo exhibition, \"A Chauk\" (a Burmese epithet for homosexual men), he showed women in positions of power and naked men as objects of desire at the gallery Myanm/art in 2020.\n","The first queer exhibition in Myanmar became a success: all of Htet's paintings sold and he decided to live exclusively from his art. Then, in February 2021, the violent military coup d'etat ended not only his dreams but also Yangon's diverse cultural life. \"I was quite devastated. I felt like the future was sort of ripped away from me, because I was planning on living and working in Yangon. I was planning on making it my home.\"\n","After some of Htet's family members were imprisoned, he saw only one way out: escaping to France with the help of an artist scholarship. \"When I left, my father was super sick at that point, so I knew that when I said goodbye to my father, it was the last time I would see him.\" His father died the next year.\n","The artist and musician Pinky also decided to leave Myanmar in spring 2021. Her bandmate was arrested and his laptop, on which joint protest actions were stored, was confiscated. Pinky Htut Aung waited in Bangkok for several months until she, too, was able to take up a scholarship in Paris. Now, like Richie Htet and Li Li, she can stay permanently as a political refugee.\n","Pinky is a multifaceted artist. The 31-year-old composes music, paints and works with sound collages. For the Berlin exhibition, she devoted her attention to clouds. \"I've been obsessed with clouds since I was a child. They're very spiritual for me. They never die, and they transform, just like our spirit.\"\n","Her milky, translucent work hangs freely from the ceiling, accompanied by celestial sounds. The clouds are not painted but instead burned into thick translucent paper with the help of a candle. \"I was afraid I would set my small apartment on fire in the process,\" she says. Pinky says she made a conscious decision to experiment with fire for the piece: \"In Paris, of course, I follow the events in Myanmar. On my smartphone, I see something on fire all the time.\" \n"," \n"," \n","\"People across the board in Myanmar are afraid,\" says Franz Xaver Augustin, who was able to reopen the Goethe-Institut in Yangon in 2014 after several years of preparation, and served as its director until 2019. \"I experienced Myanmar before it opened in 2011. It was terrible, an atmosphere of fear.\" During the period of democratization, the Institute was an important resource for artists, and it remains a refuge for them these days. Augustin has accompanied some of the artists now exhibiting in Berlin from the beginning. At the time, he would not have thought it possible that they would soon have to flee their country.\n","Richie Htet has been politicized by the military coup. In addition to homoerotic images, his work now deals with the civil war in his country.\n","The military's tactics have become more brutal during the course of the war — using sexual violence and wiping out entire villages. In addition, decapitated and dismembered bodies have been found, some of which had been disemboweled.\n","The Berlin exhibition features a disturbing painting by Htet, \"Autopsy of the Irrawaddy,\" depicting a sewn-up corpse. \"I want to show the atrocities the army is committing against the population,\" he says.\n","Artists like Richie Htet and Pinky initially stood stunned and speechless before these atrocities. They belong to the generation that blossomed with the opening of their country — and whose trust was shaken to the core after another military coup. With their paintings and installations, they have found their voices again. And they will not stop using them to speak out about the civil war on their own terms.\n","Edited by: Jon Shelton\n"," \n","\"Bruce Lee: The kung fu legend's legacy lives on 18.07.2023\"\n","\"Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water.\" Kung fu legend Bruce Lee's most famous quote is not simply his advice for would-be martial artists on how to deftly evade opponents. It also represents a philosophical way of approaching the world that still has resonance for his fans.\n","A book of his philosophical writing, \"Artist of Life\" — which was translated into and published in German for the first time in 2023 as \"Empty Your Mind\" — contains valuable insights into his peace. This aspect of the film star's life is often forgotten in remembering his legacy, half a century on from his untimely death.\n","He was born as Lee Jun-Fan in San Francisco in 1940 to Grace Ho and Lee Hoi-chuen, who was a famous Cantonese opera singer and film actor.\n","The future kung fu artist spent most of his childhood in Hong Kong where he was a child actor in several movies.\n","But soon it was clear that his interest was not limited to acting. He began boxing and dancing as a teenager and trained in Wing Chun, a form of conceptual kung fu, as a way of combining his graceful movements and love of fighting.\n","Aged 18, he moved to the United States for college, where he also taught martial arts and developed his own early form of mixed martial arts (MMA), Jeet Kune Do.\n","At the same time, he appeared in several US TV shows and movies, usually in small roles associated with martial arts.\n","It was not until he returned to Hong Kong that he landed his first leading roles, with Golden Harvest studios. He was at the top of his worldwide fame, when he died unexpectedly of a cerebral edema on July 20, 1973. He was only 32 years old. The last film released during his lifetime was \"Way of the Dragon,\" in 1972, while \"Enter the Dragon\" was completed after his death, in 1973 — both were Hollywood hits.\n","While Lee's legacy is mainly defined by his superior physical fitness and technical fighting skills, the philosophical tenets that he developed during his short life have received less attention. His own martial art style of Jeet Kune Do sums up the synthesis of these dual parts of his life.\n","\"The techniques and philosophies of Jeet Kune Do can be applied to real combat as well as challenging life situations. Jeet Kune Do consists of physical techniques and applied philosophies and requires the individual to train him or herself to their most cultivated state of being-ness,\" according to the Bruce Lee Foundation's website. Perfect awareness of one's own body and peace with one's own place in the world is vital to Lee's life work.\n","His advice to \"be water, my friend,\" has also been much-quoted down the years and is linked to this philosophy of malleability and complete awareness of one's own physical and spiritual self. Like water pouring into a cup and changing its shape, Lee advised adaptability while remaining true to one's own identity.\n","The most important part of Lee's legacy may be what he did for Asian actors in Hollywood. He was the first truly bankable Asian-American Hollywood star and, despite his untimely death, he managed to pave the way for future generations. He was one of the first Asian-American stars to have a starring role in a major international movie.\n","But his role as a well-read philosopher and thinker also deserves more attention from history. The book \"Artist of Life\" takes excerpts from his own private diaries. Meanwhile, his legacy is carried on by his daughter, Shannon Lee, who gives regular interviews and hosts a podcast about her father, simply titled, \"Bruce Lee Podcast.\"\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n"," \n","'Actress and singer Jane Birkin dies aged 76 16.07.2023'\n","British-French actress and singer Jane Birkin has passed away in Paris at the age of 76, the French Culture Ministry said on Sunday.\n","The London-born entertainer suffered from health problems in recent years that forced her to cancel concerts. She had a mild stroke in 2021.\n","Birkin first became famous internationally in 1969 when she and her lover, the late French musician Serge Gainsbourg, sang the controversial hit song \"Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus\" with sexually explicit lyrics.\n","Jane Mallory Birkin was born in London in December 1946. Her mother was an actress Judy Campbell and her father a naval officer David Birkin.\n","Her first marriage came at 17, when Birkin married composer John Barry, himself famous for composing the iconic \"James Bond\" theme. Birkin and Barry had a daughter, Kate, but their marriage fell apart after only three years. \n","In 1966, Birkin appeared nude in Michelangelo Antonioni's film \"Blow-Up\" as a part of a threesome sex scene.\n","Two years later, on a set of a romantic comedy in Paris, she met French singer and songwriter Serge Gainsbourg. Although Gainsbourg was 18 years older, the two started a 13-year-long relationship that prompted Birkin to permanently move to Paris and eventually made them France's most famous couple.\n","The two also had a daughter, Charlotte, who has become a successful actress and singer in her own right.\n","Birkin built her career and image in the 1970s, forming an iconic look which include flared jeans, mini dresses and messy bangs. In 1980, she left Gainsbourg to focus on her movie career, which also included art house productions with many of France's leading directors.\n","However, Birkin and Gainsbourg continued to cooperate professionally, with Gainsbourg writing songs for her after their split. The songwriter, who struggled with alcoholism, died of a heart attack in 1991 at  the age of 62.\n","Birkin continued to pursue her music career after Gainsbourg's death, releasing \"A la Legere\" in 1998, writing the album \"Arabesque\" in 2002 and publishing a collection of live recordings, \"Jane at the Palace\" in 2009.\n","The actress also left her mark in the world of fashion. In 1984, French luxury label Hermes named one of its handbags after her.\n","It is said that in 1981 Birkin was on a flight next to the late Jean-Louise Dumas, then CEO of Hermes. Birkin had tried to put her luggage in the overhead compartment and famously complained that she had yet to find a purse big enough to hold all of a woman's belongings. This prompted Dumas to prototype a bag that would become the iconic Birkin.\n","In 2015, Birkin asked Hermes to drop her name from the bag after animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals alerted her to the cruel farming practices of crocodiles for their leather. She later relented after Hermes investigated the practices and found them to be an \"isolated irregularity.\"\n","\"My best publicity comes from the Vatican,\" composer Serge Gainsbourg once said. His song \"Je t'aime,\" which he performed together with Jane Birkin in 1969, stirred an uproar not only in Rome. Their erotic number was even outlawed in many countries and German broadcasters refused to play the song at times. At the time, songs about sex were often indexed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","dh/jd (AFP, Reuters)\n","\"Hollywood strikes: The shows and films you'll have to wait for 14.07.2023\"\n","The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), the union representing around 160,000 film and television actors and media personalities in Hollywood and worldwide, announced it was formally joining the Writers Guild of America on the picket lines as of midnight Thursday.\n","The Hollywood writers have been on strike since early May.\n","The historic double strike has brought the US TV and movie industry to a halt.

After years of injury setbacks, she was finally on Europe's biggest stage in front of 87,000 fans.\n","With six goals in five games, Popp's blistering form led Germany to another big showdown after a few years in international wilderness.\n","But after tweaking a muscle during extra shooting practice in her final training session, Popp's dream of glory slipped away once again.\n","\"It was extremely hard to grasp that I probably couldn't play a European Championship final,\" she told DW. \"It took me a really long time to process it. There were a lot of questions — should I have trained at all, should I have taken that one more shot?\"\n","Popp pulled herself out of the starting lineup shortly before kickoff. Even though her aerial prowess would have still caused chaos for England, she sacrificed her dream for the team.\n","It's one reason why she is so loved among fans and why she commands respect from teammates who describe her as an \"icon.\"\n","This journey toward inspirational leader started at a very young age in Germany's Ruhrgebiet, where a football-mad region forged a football-obsessed future Germany captain.\n","\"I felt like I never had any other choice but to play football,\" said Popp. \"I started extremely early, when I was 4. Right from birth, I felt like I was always on a football pitch or in a gym.\"\n","Such is life for many in a region where Germany's fiercest derby, between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke, captivates national and international audiences.\n","Popp's hero growing up in the small town of Gevelsberg was Andreas Möller, whom she admired from the Westfalenstadion stands with her mother and brother in Dortmund colors.\n","\"My father, no chance, he's a Schalke fan,\" said Popp, laughing. \"I was so proud the first time I stood in the stadium and saw the Yellow Wall, felt the atmosphere. That was an incredible experience.\"\n","Football was automatically entrenched in her soul and soon seeped into her legs as she realized she was pretty good at the game.\n","At 16, Popp made two big moves that would shape her professional career — the first was enrolling in school at the Gesamtschule Berger Feld, run by none other than Schalke.\n","Here, alongside her studies, Popp trained as the only girl with talented Schalke youths like Joel Matip, Ralf Fährmann and Max Meyer, which she said was essential to her development.\n","\"I have to say, it wasn't easy to make it work,\" she said. \"At first the boys were very skeptical and didn't really know how to deal with me. But fairly early on we played five versus two and they saw 'OK, she's got something'. It calmed down quickly after that.\"\n","Just as crucially, Popp earned a contract with FCR Duisburg, a German powerhouse at the time. She was now training with World Cup winners such as Inka Grings, Simone Laudehr and Annike Krahn and arrived with the typical swagger and arrogance of a teenager.\n","\"I was very cheeky when I was younger,\" said Popp with a smile. \"I moved to Duisburg and actually thought 'Hey, I'm here now and I'm more or less better than you'. But I was soon shown very quickly that I wasn't.\"\n","\"She was quite young, in her character too,\" recalled ex-Duisburg teammate Krahn. \"But you could see that she had a certain talent, you saw that quickly on the pitch. And you could tell that she would progress in the years to come.\"\n","Popp won the UEFA Cup (now Champions League) and the German Cup in her first season at Duisburg. And in 2010, she made her name on the international stage, winning the U-20 World Cup with Germany after scoring an incredible 10 goals in six games.\n","\"She was already somewhat of a leader at that time. I wouldn't say she was a natural-born leader, but it was beginning to emerge. And she also developed in that direction quickly,\" said Krahn.\n","Under the tutelage of Grings, Popp started to master the art of goal scoring and would soon cement her place as Germany's go-to striker.\n","It was in Wolfsburg, however, that Popp truly grew into the dominant striker and leader she is today. In 11 years, she's scored 152 goals and won seven Bundesliga titles, nine German Cups and two Champions League trophies.\n","In her first season in 2012-13, Wolfsburg won the treble after defeating heavy favorites Lyon in the Champions League final.\n","\n","\"Personally I thought Lyon played with a certain arrogance, which just motivated us even more,\" said Popp. \"And we did it in the end. None of us could believe it. And we couldn't believe we'd also won the treble. That was a feeling that can't be described.\"\n","At the age of 22, Popp had won it all in club football. But then began a rough run of injuries. An injury aggravated in the Champions League final meant she missed Euro 2013, which Germany won. And she sat out Euro 2017 as well after injuring herself during pre-tournament preparations.\n","And although she did win Gold at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics with Germany, injuries were threatening to curtail her international career, so much so that at times she contemplated retirement.\n","\"I think you learn something new with every injury,\" said Krahn. \"You get to know your body better, you develop your personality differently, and value your time on the pitch differently.\"\n","So when Popp finally got to play in that European Championship in 2022, there was a feeling of redemption in the air.\n","That fateful injury sustained in shooting practice, however, robbed her of her big moment. Germany lost 2-1 in extra time without their inspirational captain, even though she was their biggest fan on the side of the pitch.\n","\"I think, with a bit of reflection, she can be very proud of what she achieved. And also proud of how she dealt with it,\" said Krahn.\n","Now, it's time to go again. And there is fire in Popp's belly as she looks to lead Germany back to the top of international football at the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\n","\"She shows that you should just keep at it, stay on your path and not let anything get you down. She's definitely inspired me a lot,\" said Kathrin Hendrich. \"Poppi is an icon. If you ask anyone in Germany which footballer comes to mind first, then she would be top of the list.\"\n","That adulation makes Popp the star attraction whenever Germany trains or plays, but she's purely focused on leading her team back to the top of international football. She's said multiple times in the past weeks that Germany believe they can go all the way.\n","\"I'm really looking forward to the World Cup. And I think we can play a big role in the title race,\" she said.\n","Germany face Morocco, Colombia and South Korea in Group H. Topping the group and navigating the round of 16 could line up a potential rematch against England in the quarterfinals.\n","There's little doubt Popp will have extra motivation to play in that showdown. It will be another chance to make up for lost time, and find redemption.\n","The 34-year-old is one of the biggest stars of women's football. The forward has won two FIFA Women's World Cup titles and an Olympic gold. Her daughter, Elena, arrived in 2020. \"As much as I love playing soccer, and doing that every single day, I now play for more than myself. I don't know if I would say I'm a different player.

Not long after, he was transferred from prison No. 22 in   Ivatsevichy in the Brest region to Grodno. Pushkin had a hard time from the beginning, said Aliaksandr Ivulin, a journalist and former political prisoner who was in the same jail as Pushkin.\n","He was \"too friendly,\" Ivulin said, even to the prison guards, who took away his notes and drawings without giving him a reason.\n","Once moved to prison No. 1, his exchange of letters with the Belarusian artist Lera Lasuk ended, DW has learned. After that, Pushkin was only allowed to write to his family. From the new prison, he sent drawings and described his daily life and his cellmates. He made sketches of larger works that he wanted to complete once he was released.\n","\"We had some disagreements, but we were joined by our love of art and of Belarus. I value him for his bright, iconic pieces, for his courage and for standing up for his principles,\" said Lasuk.\n","Pushkin was a non-conformist painter, theatermaker, performer and curator. He staged one of his first performance pieces during Soviet rule in Belarus in 1989. And not on any day: He chose the 71st anniversary of the Belarusian People's Republic. The state's existence was proclaimed on March 25, 1918, under German protectorate, but ceased to exist shortly after when part of its territory was won by the Polish armed forces and the other part by the Soviet Red Army in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919 to 1921.\n","Pushkin began the anniversary with a march through Independence Avenue in Minsk, followed by about a hundred supporters carrying a paper stork and 71 white balloons. Pushkin and 35 other people were arrested, and the artist received a two-year suspended sentence.\n","Pushkin's most famous performance was \"Dung for the President\" in July 1999. On the fifth anniversary of Alexander Lukashenko's ascent to power, the artist transported a pile of manure to the presidential administration in Minsk, threw worthless ruble notes on top and added the country's constitution plus a portrait of the ruler for good measure. Then he stabbed everything with a pitchfork.\n","For this stunt, the artist was also given a two-year suspended sentence. Pushkin reenacted the performance at an exhibition in Kyiv on March 25, 2021. This appears to have prompted Belarusian authorities to charge him with \"desecration of state symbols.\"\n","Pushkin also worked on the restoration of historical buildings and on church frescoes. His most important work, in his view, was the decoration of the new church of his home village Bobr, near Minsk.\n","In one of the frescoes, Pushkin depicted Lukashenko and the then-metropolitan (a leadership position in some Orthodox churches) of the unrecognized Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Filaret, among sinners, surrounded by forces of the Belarusian special police unit OMON. The fresco was later painted over.\n","Rights organizations in Belarus, like Viasna, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and Legal Initiative, considered Pushkin a political prisoner. The leader of the Belarusian democratic opposition movement, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in exile in Lithuania, has blamed the artist's death on Lukashenko.\n","\"Ales Pushkin was the embodiment of the indomitable spirit of the Belarusian people. He died as a political prisoner of the regime, and the responsibility lies with his jailor, Lukashenka & his cronies,\" she wrote on Twitter, using another spelling of the president's name.\n","\"Ales used his art to fight for freedom and build a new Belarus without tyranny,\" she added. \"He dreamed of a free and democratic Belarus. Now we must continue his work and make his dream come true.\"\n","This article was first published in German.\n","\"How to unleash creativity: Music legend Rick Rubin's advice 13.07.2023\"\n","\"I set out to write a book about what to do to make a great work of art. Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be,\" writes Rick Rubin about his approach to \"The Creative Act: A Way of Being.\"\n","You can pretty much find a best-selling self-help book about anything these days, from decluttering your mind to your wardrobe. Sometimes self-improvement book themes seem so trite, it leaves you thinking — is this really what's going to make you transform your life?\n","But since the prolific US music producer is already seen by many in the industry as a guru, it only makes sense to have him share his wisdom with the masses. \"The Creative Act: A Way of Being\" brings creativity into a new realm of self-discovery. \n","Rubin started his career in the 1980s as a 20-year-old university student, when he founded his record label, Def Jam, in his dorm room in New York.\n","After Russell Simmons joined the company, things took off. Rubin discovered the Beastie Boys, and convinced them to abandon punk and turn to rap.\n","Def Jam played a pivotal role in popularizing hip hop, by signing acts including LL Cool J, Run-DMC and Public Enemy, and later Jay-Z and Foxy Brown.\n","Rubin helped Aerosmith make a comeback in 1986, recording a remake of their 1975 song, \"Walk This Way,\" with the rap trio Run-DMC. \n","Later, Rubin sold his shares in Def Jam for a three-digit million sum, moved to Los Angeles, started a new label, and also worked as a producer for artists signed to other record labels.\n","In the 1990s, the song-doctor with the long untamed beard produced the Red Hot Chili Peppers album \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" that shot the band into international popularity. Rubin's touch also allowed country music icon Johnny Cash to make a major comeback with his award-winning \"American Recordings\" album series. \n","He helped the heavy metal band Metallica out of a musical crisis with the 2008 album \"Death Magnetic,\" and produced works with many more of the world's top stars. His CV also includes collaborations with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Mick Jagger, Eminem, Rage Against the Machine, U2, Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Adele and many more.\n","Rubin has said in interviews that he doesn't even know how to play an instrument, nor does he have much of an idea about studio technology. To produce an album, he places importance on how he feels.\n","In his book, he puts it this way: \"When the work has five mistakes, it's not finished. But when a work has eight mistakes, it might be. Sometimes deciding a work is finished is more about surrender than victory.\"\n","Rick Rubin is a spiritual man, drawing inspiration from Eastern philosophy and cosmic influences. The studio on his ranch in the hills of Malibu is called Shangri-La, named after the fictional paradise in the high Tibetan mountains in James Hilton's novel \"Lost Horizon.\"\n","Rubin has enough knowledge and experience to write 10 books. It is said that some publishers hoped he'd spice up his book with anecdotes of big names he's worked with to make it more commercial.\n","But Rubin avoids name-dropping and he also doesn't think he has all the answers. In the preface, he advises readers to take on what helps them and leave the rest.  \n","Various obstacles, including self-doubt and everyday distractions, get in the way of living out our best creative selves, according to Rubin. He has developed his own strategies to deal with creative blocks and the pressure to exceed or at least match the success of the last album.\n","Despite all the hits, Rubin's portfolio is by no means limited to successful records. For him, as he states in his book,  success is measured neither by popularity nor by money, but internally.\n","In the case of a creative block, Rubin recommends visualizing a completely different audience for a song that's being worked on, or simply writing fewer lyrics, because sometimes letting go is the best way to stick to a project. Sometimes he simply turns off the lights in the studio to change the atmosphere.\n","Nevertheless, creativity also requires a certain level of discipline for which Rubin lays down some ground rules, even though he later in the book contradicts himself by writing that artistic creation is based on disregarding rules, letting them go and subverting them.\n","Some of the wisdom he shares in \"The Creative Act\" might appear too simplistic, including truisms such as, \"The better you feel, the better things go.\"\n","Other parts of the book give more substantial advice, though they often echo words of wisdom already heard elsewhere: \"Creativity can just be a relationship with yourself. No one else needs to be in the equation,\" he writes. \"Sometimes the therapeutic value of making the work is the outcome. And that's enough.\"\n","The producer, whose net worth is estimated at  $300 million, often emphasizes in the book that creativity shouldn't be about sales: \"Putting commercial concerns before personal taste is a losing battle.\"\n","Anything can be a source of inspiration, he says, especially nature. Rubin recommends always walking through life attentively and trying things out without worrying about the meaning or a measurable result. It stands in contrast to society's capitalistic values.\n","Obviously, not every creative undertaking requires a fat bank account. Nevertheless, the challenge for ordinary people in implementing Rubin's lessons is likely to be the daily grind, which is not exactly known as a driving force for creativity. Creative contemplation is a luxury that won't pay the bills.\n","In one of last year's episodes of Rubin's podcast \"Broken Record,\" he talked with the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis. They discussed the band's two latest albums, \"Unlimited Love\" and \"Return of the Dream Canteen,\" which were produced by Rubin. Released within a few months in 2022, they received generally positive reviews.\n","Both producer and singer seemed very pleased with the results. They talked about recording in Hawaii, where they were able to work undisturbed for months during the pandemic lockdown. Every day, Kiedis rode his bike through heavenly landscapes to work with Rubin.\n","Kiedis shared that he would not have been able to do it without escaping the daily grind, big-city traffic and other distractions.\n","Perhaps palm trees are not a prerequisite for creativity. But they don't hurt either.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","The most recent biopic, released June 23, is about the life of Elvis Presley, played by Austin Butler.

One of the aspects that makes the series so popular is that Tom Cruise performs many of the film stunts himself, without the aid of CGI or stunt doubles. That approach has turned him into an action megastar.\n","Unforgettable scenes in the previous movies include Tom Cruise climbing up the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, or hanging from a plane as it takes off.\n","A highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump.\n","Like the \"John Wick\" films with Keanu Reeves, the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise counters the trend of having blockbuster action scenes created exclusively through CGI.\n","Cruise is perhaps the most famous action star doing his own stunts today. But other actors, including older ones, also insist on filming dangerous sequences themselves in order to make the movie feel more authentic.\n","This includes Chinese martial arts legend Jackie Chan, who has insisted on doing practically all of his stunts himself since the 1970s.\n","His most notable performances are in \"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow\" (1978), \"Police Story\" and \"Police Story 2\" (1985 and 1988) and \"Armour of God\" (1986).\n","During the filming of the latter, Chan almost died while filming a relatively simple stunt. Jumping from a ledge onto a tree, he fell and crashed onto a rock, breaking a few ribs and cracking his skull.\n","In her Oscar-winning role in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" 60-year-old Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh portrays a laundromat owner who in an alternate universe is also a famous martial arts movie star — inspired by the actress' own career.\n","Yeoh, who is also among the stars renowned for performing stunts herself, played alongside Jackie Chan in action classics like \"Police Story 3: Supercop\" or \"Supercop 2.\" She rose to international prominence with the 2000 martial arts film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" in which she also did her own stunts.\n","Canadian actor Keanu Reeves doesn't shy away from getting his hands dirty in action-packed scenes either. In films like \"Speed\" (1994), \"Matrix\" (1999) or the \"John Wick\" series, he jumps out of moving cars and fights his opponents in nerve-wracking scenes.\n","Following the release of \"John Wick 3,\" Reeves confirmed in an interview that he did almost all of the stunt work himself: \"I do all of the action. I'm 90 percent of what's happening there. I'm maintaining the connection to the audience, and with the story.\"\n","\"Indiana Jones\" star Harrison Ford can't be left out of any list of actors performing their own stunts.\n","The 80-year-old actor has had an impressive film career spanning six decades. His most successful films include the \"Star Wars\" saga and the \"Indiana Jones\" series.\n","The opening scene of the first Indiana Jones movie,\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is particularly iconic, with Harrison Ford running away from a giant boulder that is chasing him. Even though the rock was a prop, it was still heavy enough to seriously injure the actor, who was not doubled in the scene.\n","Ford completely immersed himself in the role of daredevil archeologist Indiana Jones.\n","In the recently released \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" he still took over many stunts himself, dislocating his shoulder while filming.

Recent productions have focused on the fight for women's freedom in Iran and brought together a group of artists \"in exile.\"\n","But in 2021, a cloud descended on the famous theater, when some of those in power and executive director Shermin Langhoff faced allegations of bullying and misuse of power — of creating what German magazine Der Spiegel called a \"climate of fear.\"\n","The theater, along with other German publicly funded stages, promised to take the allegations seriously and put change into effect if necessary.\n","But recent research by German public broadcaster ARD shows that 90% of those who responded to an anonymous survey — apparently including former and current employees of Maxim Gorki Theater — claimed to have experienced abuse. In most cases the allegations were of verbal abuse, but several cases of alleged physical and sexual abuses were also reported.\n","Theater bosses have questioned the representative nature of the survey, given that it was conducted anonymously and without independent fact checking. But according to the biggest union of German theater workers, the GDBA (Guild of the German Stage), the problems the survey highlights are very real.\n","\"We take the survey very seriously. To be clear: It is not a scientific study. The survey itself also explicitly presents its results as non-representative. But that does not make it any less meaningful,\" trade union general secretary Lauren Schubbe told DW.\n","\"The (ARD subsidiary) RBB team's research shows that hundreds of theater professionals are willing to take the time and feel the need to share their experiences of abuse of power in theaters. It has produced 400 detailed accounts of specific cases, each one of which is one too many.\"\n","He mentioned the #MeToo movement and the conditions that emerged through the COVID pandemic as reasons why people may now be more willing to speak out.\n","\"However, we do not conclude from this that there was less abuse of power in theaters in the past,\" he added. \"On the contrary, there have already been the first tentative successes and measures to curb it.\"\n","In reaction to the #MeToo wave of scandals, several theaters have introduced codes of conduct over the course of the past few years. But measuring how effective these codes of conduct are is not an exact science.\n","\"This is a situation that cannot be tolerated,\" Claudia Schmitz, the director of the Deutscher Bühnenverein, an organization that represents 430 German theaters, said in a statement. \"The question is how to proceed, and my answer is that the path that the stages have been taking since 2018 must be consistently continued.\"\n","Her solution referred to the values-based code of conduct which many German theaters agreed to in 2018 and again in 2021.\n","Volksbühne, for example, one of Berlin's other major publicly-funded theaters, told DW that \"the staff council and the women's representative of the Volksbühne regularly invite employees to a meeting of the Code of Conduct working group. This is an open committee of Volksbühne employees that has set itself the task of promoting a harassment-free working environment.\"\n","Claudia Schmitz from the Deutscher Bühnenverein is clear that such programs can work: \"It is not just a piece of paper from the association, but an expression of opinion from all members, including the theater directors and artistic directors, who say that we have a responsibility to ensure that the theater is a space free of fear and that we deal with power in a way that does not lead to discrimination or injury,\" Schmitz said. She also indicated that a fresh generation at the helm of certain theaters may help implement these codes of conduct.\n","Codes of conduct have also been brought in by organizations connected with German stars who have recently been embroiled in allegations of misconduct in other industries, including Till Lindemann of band Rammstein and actor, producer and director Till Schweiger.\n","But union representative Schubbe said that such codes of conduct are \"toothless\" unless they are \"backed up by concrete and binding measures such as counseling services, complaints procedures and sanction options.\"\n","\"In order to achieve fundamental improvements, we must also question what makes abuse of power in theaters structurally favorable and then also change these structures,\" he added.\n","One of the problems raised by respondents to the survey is related to the length of contracts. Contracts are regularly only renewed every few theater seasons, meaning that those whose visas and residency rights are linked to their jobs may be more vulnerable to abuse and less likely to speak out.\n","An ongoing dispute between the Bühnenverein, representing the employers, and the trade union, representing the employees, once again failed to reach any conclusions on the topic in June.\n","Like all performing arts industries, German theaters have struggled to bounce back since the pandemic and the ongoing cost of living crisis.\n","DW has been in contact with Maxim Gorki Theater about this report, who were unable to provide a comment owing to the theater's summer break.\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'Japan: Tattoo artists want to wash off criminal connection 10.07.2023'\n","Japan's Bunshin Tattoo Museum in Yokohama is dedicated to the work of Yoshihito Nakano, who is better known in the body art world as Horiyoshi III, a master of traditional Japanese tattooing.\n","The museum is presided over by Horiyoshi's wife, Mayumi Nakano. Wearing a sleeveless shirt that reveals entwined flower tattoos in vivid reds, greens and yellows from her wrists to her shoulders, she confides that she received her first tattoo when she was 20. It was at the hands of her husband. \n","\"Tattoos are misunderstood in Japan,\" she tells DW, surrounded by stencils of intricate tattoo designs and pictures of his satisfied clients.\n","\"Tattoos have always been associated with the underworld gangs, but I had hoped that would change over time. Even though there is no stigma attached to tattoos in other countries, Japanese society is not ready to change,\" says Nakano.\n","Now 77, Horiyoshi has said in interviews that he first became mesmerized by tattoos at the age of 11 or 12 after he saw a yakuza member with a traditional full body tattoo at his local public bathhouse. He earned the title Horiyoshi III, after working as an apprentice for the legendary tattoo master Shodai Horiyoshi of Yokohama.\n","The winner of countless awards for his work, Horiyoshi used to do the outlines of his designs by hand until the 1990s, when he started using electric machines. Colors and shading are still added with the traditional \"tebori\" technique, which uses a slender bamboo or metal rod with needles attached to the tip.\n","As with most Japanese tattoo artists, Horiyoshi's designs are variations of iridescent \"koi\" carp, dragons, tigers, snakes, peony flowers and maple leaves. Others are inspired by Buddhist deities or creatures from mythology. Bright pink cherry blossoms are also popular designs.\n","In an interview with The Japan Times newspaper, Horiyoshi once said \"The creatures I draw come alive on somebody's skin.\"\n","However, there is no doubt that the vast majority of Japanese perceive tattoos as a mark of criminality. And that has not washed off over time. \n","In ancient times, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, the Ainu, practiced tattooing with ink made from the indigo plant. The people in the islands to the far south of mainland Japan, then the Ryukyu Kingdom but now incorporated into Japan as Okinawa Prefecture, also applied skin art inspired by their environment and culture.\n","During the Edo period, between 1603 and 1867, rule over the nation became more centralized and the punishment for certain types of crimes was tattooing.\n","Thieves were tattooed and a murderer had a mark permanently added to his or her face. Unsurprisingly, tattoos became synonymous with criminals, even though there was the parallel development of decorative tattoos and the emergence of a distinctive artistic genre. \n","Tattoos were outlawed entirely in the early years of the Meiji period, which began in 1868. It was believed that elaborate markings would shock or offend foreigners as Japan opened its borders and sent political and trade missions abroad.\n","An underground tattooing industry thrived, however, with foreigners particularly keen to obtain Japanese-style skin art. \n","The British royal family was particularly interested in Japanese tattoos, with Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh having a writhing dragon inked on his right forearm in Tokyo in 1869. Similarly, Prince Albert and George, Prince of Wales, were sailors aboard HMS Bacchante and both were tattooed during a visit in 1881. \n","Tattooing became legal once again in 1948, but it was unable to shake its criminal connotations, especially as tens of thousands of men became members of rival yakuza gangs in the difficult decades following World War II. \n","Given that association, companies have long refused to employ anyone with a tattoo simply out of concern that customers or business partners will assume the firm has links to Japan's criminal underworld.\n","Equally, anyone with a tattoo is likely to be banned from a public swimming pool or a \"sento\" or \"onsen\" public bath. People with visible tattoos get a wide berth on beaches.  \n","However, despite the Japanese public's refusal to embrace tattoos, there are signs that the government's attitude is changing. Concerned at falling recruitment rates, Japan's Defense Ministry has indicated that it is planning to alter its regulations to let men or women with a tattoo to join the armed forces. \n","\n","\"In Japan, tattoos are still very much a niche subculture associated with people in music, art or fashion,\" said Kyle Cleveland, a professor of Japanese culture at the Tokyo campus of Temple University. \"But it is important to distinguish between the historic roots and the links with the yakuza and the tattoos that are being worn today, especially by young people,\" he told DW.\n","There was a debate in Japanese society before the Tokyo Olympic Games over athletes from all over the world competing with visible tattoos, Cleveland said, which continues today as foreign tourists flock to Japan. But these are distinct from the tattoos that still mark out the underworld, he added. \n","The tattoos that gang members wear are \"deeply symbolic and are designed to indicate membership\" of a criminal group, Cleveland said.\n","On the other hand, designs that are more common elsewhere, such as playful designs of flowers or animals, a favorite quote or image, are extremely individualistic, Cleveland points out, and often mark a life transition, such as a marriage, birth or death. \n","Japanese society, at present, negatively conflates the two, he added, making it hard for tattoos to gain traction. \n","In the Bunshin Tattoo Museum, Mayumi Nakano is not convinced change is on the horizon in Japan, even as tattoos remain popular elsewhere around the world. \n","On a table stands a framed picture of David Bowie when he visited Horiyoshi III's studio in about 1990. \n","\"He was a real gentleman,\" she says. \"And he understood.\"\n","Edited by: Wesley Rahn\n","\n","\"How the Nazis destroyed Berlin's thriving fashion industry 10.07.2023\"\n","Even though Berlin Fashion Week  takes place twice every year, in January and now from July 10-13, the German city doesn't exactly hold the title of the capital of fashion. \n","That's why even Berliners are surprised when they find out that their city used to be a thriving fashion hub before World War II. And it was mainly thanks to Jewish entrepreneurs who were pioneers of modern fashion in Berlin.\n","The clothing industry took off in Berlin in the 1830s. Industrial sewing machines introduced in the 1850s were a game changer: A shirt could be made in one hour instead of eight.\n","Amid this industrialization process, Germany's social and political context allowed Jewish entrepreneurs to set the tone. \n","For centuries, Jewish people living in Germany had been suffering from legal restrictions that affected their ability to make a livelihood and pushed most of them into poverty. Many were peddlers trading in haberdashery and second-hand clothes, while wealthy Jews traded in fine fabrics, explains Uwe Westphal, a freelance journalist and author of \"Fashion Metropolis Berlin 1836 - 1939. The Story of the Rise and Destruction of the Jewish Fashion Industry.\"\n","Westphal, who has dedicated almost 40 years to researching, lecturing and writing about the forgotten Jewish fashion industry in Berlin, points out that the Industrial Revolution in the mid-19th century was followed by the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, which enshrined new rights for Jews in its constitution, allowing the German Jewish population  to thrive.\n","In 1871, there were just over 800,000 inhabitants in Berlin. By the 1920s, the German capital became a metropolis with a population of over four million, 4% of which were Jewish.\n","Jews flocked from rural areas to the big city to look for opportunities. \"Amongst them were tailors, seamstresses and entrepreneurs such as David Leib Levin, who came from Köningsberg. He opened a factory for women's coats, and in 1840 was one of the first to use fixed prices for his wares,\" says Westphal.\n","Fashion trends from Paris, especially haute couture, were too expensive for the middle classes and white-collar workers, who were nevertheless increasingly interested in looking fashionable. So the Jewish entrepreneurs \"came up with the idea of producing cheap fashionable clothing according to standardized measures,\" explains Westphal. \"The demand was there, and the industry grew rapidly.\"\n","Berlin's fashion industry reached its height in the roaring 20s, with more than 2,700 fashion companies predominantly owned by Jewish families. Names such as the Manheimer brothers, David Leib Levin, Nathan Israel and Hermann Gerson were synonymous with the new and growing trend of ready-to-wear fashion. \n","Jewish entrepreneurs quickly adapted to the new needs of the industrial era: \"They had a feeling for what people liked and they had international connections to fabric producers,\" Westphal says.\n","The garments were sold in glamorous department stores, which were mainly owned by Jewish families too.\n","Berlin's fashion industry also enjoyed international success and exported to the US, the Netherlands, England, Scandinavia and Argentina. Berlin offered cheap, stylish and high-quality day-to-day clothing. The ideas for designs were copied straight off from the Parisian couture shows. Business was booming.\n","Antisemitism and envy of the Jews' success in the industry existed from early on. But with Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the Jewish-owned businesses suffered massive blows, starting with the boycott against Jewish stores established on April 1 that same year.\n","The companies of Jewish fashion manufacturers were then systematically taken over by members of the Nazi party: \"Jews were soon forbidden to take out bank loans. For the clothing companies, this was a disaster. You couldn't have fashion shows without bank guarantees,\" explains Westphal, which is why Jews were forced into making Nazi party members partners in their companies to have access to funds, and finally transferring ownership at ridiculously low prices. \n","In the November pogroms of 1938, groups of Nazi supporters stormed hundreds of companies on Hausvogteiplatz in the Berlin district of Mitte, which was the city's center of Jewish fashion. They destroyed everything they could get their hands on: \"Of the 2,700 Jewish fashion companies, only 24 were left, and they too were confiscated by 1940 at the latest,\" says Westphal.\n","According to Westphal, the Nazis' main interest was the real estate around Hausvogteiplatz, because the party was looking for new offices.\n","Later, forced laborers worked in fashion workshops set near concentration camps.  \n","Josef Neckermann and Hugo Boss are just two prominent names among several owners of companies who profited greatly from the Nazi forced hostile takeover of Jewish businesses. \"They oversaw production of clothing and military uniforms,\" points out Westphal. \n","Berlin fashion designers in the 1950s and 60s were content to have no Jewish competition. But by then, West Germany's fashion industry had moved from Berlin to Düsseldorf and Munich, due to the division of the city. The East German state had no real interest in fashion. By the 70s, Germany had became a minor player in fashion, Westphal explains.\n","\"Everything that fashion once was, especially in the 1920s — fashion schools, the overarching culture between fashion, architecture, the Bauhaus, music, the film industry and the visual arts in general — all of that was completely destroyed,\" says Westphal.\n","\"What I find scary is that since 1945, nobody wants to remember this fashion culture. There's no commemoration of the many Jewish fashion designers. This stands in stark contrast to many German companies that were deeply involved in the Nazi state and have tried to make good since then,\" says the expert. \n","In the early 90s, Westphal's frustration led to campaigning for a memorial at Hausvogteiplatz with the support of the Jewish community in Berlin. In 2000, the memorial was inaugurated with funding by the Berlin government.\n","Berlin's traditional Jewish fashion industry is long gone, but as part of the upcoming Days of Jewish Culture festival, a fashion show of contemporary Jewish and Israeli designers will take place on September 7. According to Westphal, it is the first Jewish fashion show in the German capital since 1939.\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'Should Soviet monuments be dismantled or preserved? 09.07.2023'\n","For some, Soviet monuments symbolize the Red Army's occupation and the Stalinist regime's repression; for others, they commemorate the USSR's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.\n","Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 once again fueled the debate in different Eastern European countries, including in Latvia and Poland, where imposing Soviet monuments, such as the Victory Monument in Riga, were hastily dismantled.\n","In Bulgaria, however, public opinion is strongly divided on what should be done with the communist-era monuments. One of the reasons for this division is the lack of historical reappraisal of the communist past. As a result, a large part of the population still romanticizes this period.\n","At the center of the controversy is a memorial complex known as the Monument to the Soviet Army, right in the middle of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.\n","Over the past decade, the association \"Initiative for Dismantling the Soviet Army Monument\" has been campaigning to have it removed from the city center.\n","The monument was built in 1954, 10 years after the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria, during a period of suppression of all resistance against the Bulgarian communist regime.\n","\"Following the invasion of the Red Army, a communist regime was established in Bulgaria. This monument was created under an unfree regime, at a time when occupiers called themselves liberators,\" says Marta Georgieva from the Initiative for Dismantling the Soviet Army Monument. The association aims to increase the population's awareness for their history through their actions. \n","Marta Georgieva also sees parallels between what happened in Bulgaria at the time and what is happening in Ukraine today: \"An army simply invades a country and declares itself a liberator when it wins the war.\" \n","During the Second World War, from 1941 to 1944, Bulgaria was on the side of the Axis powers, but did not send soldiers to the Eastern Front and refused to declare war on the Soviet Union.\n","In August 1944, Bulgaria terminated its pact with Nazi-Germany and declared neutrality. However, Bulgaria's offer of an armistice was rejected by Moscow and the Soviet Union declared war on Sofia. Within the first three months after the Red Army's invasion of Bulgaria on September 9, 1944, a communist regime was installed, and between 18,000 and 30,000 people — including clergy, journalists, former ministers and landowners — were murdered.   \n","But people in Bulgaria know too little about this dark chapter of their history. It's a gap that needs to be filled — and getting rid of the monument is part of that process, according to Marta Georgieva and her team. \n","\"We want this square to be depoliticized, because this monument divides us as a society,\" says Kuper Saparev, another member of the initiative. \"Because of the monument, we cannot use the square, it doesn't look to the future, but rather serves as criminal propaganda of the past and causes a lot of tension.\" \n","As early as 1993, the city council had decided to dismantle the monument. But since then, various institutions have been dodging responsibility for its removal.\n","\"We've proven that this is not a cultural monument, and the authorities have confirmed that it's not a soldiers' memorial,\" says Marta Georgieva.\n","Not everybody supports the idea of dismantling the monument.\n","In fact, there are many people who believe it should rather be preserved: \"This is a joint memorial that must remind us that so many people died in this heinous, bloody and ruthless war — people who never wanted the war. Their memory must be kept alive,\" says an older women holding a picture of a relative who died in the Second World War. She is among a group of people gathered in front of the monument in Sofia at a commemorative event held on May 9, also known as Victory Day. Every year, the date marking the end of World War II is celebrated in different former communist-led countries.\n","In the eyes of those who commemorate Victory Day and wave Russian flags in the center of EU-member state Bulgaria, the monument serves as a symbol of the fight against fascism — a fight they feel is still ongoing, as different people told DW at the commemorative event, with some believing the \"West\" is the actual aggressor in the current war against Ukraine. \n","Putin's propaganda narrative falls on fertile ground in Bulgaria, a country that has never completely escaped Russian influence. The country has not yet come to terms with its past. There is too little historical reappraisal, and too much disinformation. The horrors of the communist era were barely discussed for a long time, allowing problematic interpretations of the past to spread. \n","A third option for the monument would be to turn it into a museum or relocate it to an existing institution, such as Sofia's Museum of Art from the Socialist Period, which displays various portrayals of Lenin, Che Guevara, Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov and many other leaders from the communist past. \n","\"During that time, art had to serve propaganda. It became a tool of political power and ideology. The Communist Party melded with the state, and this one-party system controlled every sphere of public, political and cultural life. Art was not excluded from these processes,\" says curator Nikolai Ushtavaliiski. \n","Ushtavaliiski has been director of the museum since 2011 and has followed the debate over the Soviet Army monument in Sofia with interest. But as the monument might not fit in the museum's football pitch-sized park, the curator points out that there is another location that is also being considered for it.   \n","The monument could be dismantled and relocated to the city of Dimitrovgrad, 220 kilometers (137 miles) from Sofia, he says. \"The interesting aspect there is that this city was founded in the early years of socialism. It was built out of nothing. Dimitrovgrad became a symbol for the construction of a new, socialist society in Bulgaria,\" points out Ushtavaliiski, who therefore feels that since \"Dimitrovgrad itself is a monument to socialism, a monument like the one in Sofia, which honors a foreign army, could find an appropriate place there.\" \n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","('Two rediscovered Rembrandt portraits sell for €11 million at auction '\n"," '06.07.2023')\n","Almost 200 years ago, a British family bought two oil portraits by the 17th century Dutch master Rembrandt at a Christie's auction. Since then, the paintings have remained tucked away from the public eye, and were completely forgotten by scholars.\n","The portraits were among the highlights of Christie's July 6 Old Masters sale, part of the auction house's Classic Week. They were sold for 9.5 million British pounds (€11.1 million, $12 million), surpassing Christie's estimates, set between 5-8 million pounds.\n"," \n","\n","The 20-centimeter-high oval paintings are Rembrandt's smallest known portraits. The rare and intimate portrayals depict an elderly plumber named Jan Willemsz van der Pluym and his wife, Jaapgen Carels. \n","By 1635, the year the works were painted, Rembrandt had already been living in Amsterdam for a few years, and the successful artist was renowned for his large portraits commissioned by wealthy families.\n","The van der Pluyms were an affluent family who owned a garden next to that of Rembrandt's mother in Leiden, the painter's hometown. \n","There were also family ties between the portrayed couple and the painter: one of the seven children in the van der Pluym family was married to Rembrandt's first cousin. Born from this union, the artist Karel van der Pluym is also believed to have studied under Rembrandt between 1645-1648.\n","An old friend of Rembrandt's, Lievens captured the painter known for his impressive self-portraiture. The two artists, friends since childhood, shared a studio in Amsterdam until 1631, when Lievens began to travel for his career. Rembrandt, in contrast, never went abroad, although he is said to have been inspired by the Italian masters\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","The portraits remained in the ownership of the van der Pluym family until 1760, when they were sold at an auction in Amsterdam.

After nearly two years of analysis, they concluded that the portraits were indeed Rembrandt works.\n","The newly discovered Rembrandts have been described by Pettifer as \"one of the most exciting discoveries we have made in the old masters' field in recent years.\"\n","This is not the first time Christie's has made headlines for auctioning Rembrandt's rediscovered works.\n","In 2009, the auction house sold \"Portrait of a man, half-length, with his arms akimbo.\" Painted in 1658, the work had been unseen in public for nearly 40 years and sold for 20.2 million pounds, which at the time was a record auction price for the 17th-century artist.\n","In 2016, Christie's negotiated a first-of-its-kind deal to sell two Rembrandt portraits from the Rothschild Collection to the Louvre Museum in Paris and  the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The coveted portraits had not been on display since 1956 and were also unknown works by the Dutch master.\n","Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier\n","'David Adjaye: Star architect accused of sexual misconduct 05.07.2023'\n","Famed British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye has been accused of sexual misconduct, according to a report by the Financial Times published on July 4. \n","Accused by three women, all former employees, Adjaye has stepped back from a number of roles, while denying the allegations.\n","Adjaye was slated to help create a new Holocaust Memorial and Learning Center in the United Kingdom, and was a design advocate for the City of London. He has stepped down from both roles.\n","His commission to design a new national cathedral in Accra, Ghana has also now been called into question, as well as a museum of West African art in Benin City, Nigeria. The latter, known as the Edo Museum of West African Art, was set to house some of the Benin Bronzes that Germany returned to Nigeria in 2021.\n","The three women who have accused Adjaye were all employees of his firm. The claims were wide-ranging, encompassing \"different forms of exploitation — from alleged sexual assault and sexual harassment by him to a toxic work culture,\" according to their statement. The three women were not named.\n","The accusers have said the incidents, which allegedly took place in 2018 and 2019, have \"gone unchecked for years.\" One incident allegedly took place in an airport bathroom in Johannesburg.\n","\"I absolutely reject any claims of sexual misconduct, abuse or criminal wrongdoing,\" Adjaye told DW in a statement. \"These allegations are untrue, distressing for me and my family and run counter to everything I stand for.\"\n","\"I am ashamed to say that I entered into relationships which though entirely consensual, blurred the boundaries between my professional and personal lives.

In 1972, he had his major international breakthrough with the album \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,\" and the world tour in support of the record continued until 1973.\n","The final date of the tour took place in Yokohama, Japan. Bowie, who suffered from a fear of flying, decided to take an unconventional route back home to England: going from Japan to Siberia on the passenger ship SS Felix Dzerzhinsky, then a week-long rail journey on the Trans-Siberian Railway, followed by further train connections through Poland, Germany and France. \n","Now the late rock star's unusual trip through what was then the USSR is the subject of an exhibition titled \"David Bowie in the Soviet Union\" at the Wende Museum in Culver City, California. The Wende is an art museum, cultural center and archive of the Cold War, which, according to its website, \"explores social, political, and cultural change.\" The photos in the exhibition are by Geoff MacCormack, a member of Bowie's band and a childhood friend.\n","MacCormack and Bowie met in the 1950s while playing in the London suburb of Bromley, where they both grew up, and they fast became inseparable.\n","In a video interview published on the Wende Museum website, MacCormack recalls growing up with Bowie, their time together at school, in the Cub Scouts and the church choir — and their trip through the Soviet Union. MacCormack describes vividly how the two boys fell under the spell of rock 'n' roll, calling it \"a force of nature\" that \"blew us away.\"\n","They shared that love of music into adulthood. So when Bowie was about to embark on the 1972/73 tour, he recruited MacCormack as a backing vocalist, percussionist and dancer. \"He phoned me up and told me I was joining his band; he didn't ask me,\" MacCormack tells Joes Segal, curator of the Wende Museum, in the interview.\n","Aside from music, MacCormack's great passion is photography. And thanks to the closeness he shared with Bowie, he was able to capture images of the rock star on that train journey that others couldn't: a Bowie relaxed, lost in thought, focused, and excited by all the new experiences the trip brought them.\n","Traveling as they did allowed the two to really engage with the country and its people. There were repeated drinking sessions with soldiers, sailors and tourists; and the bleary mornings-after were captured by MacCormack's lens. He also recalls singing along with Bowie to an ever-present cassette of \"cheesy\" Russian cover versions of Beatles songs. \n","One of the highlights of the journey was their two-day stop in Moscow, where they visited the Kremlin and the socialist showpiece department store GUM — and avidly watched the traditional May Day Parade.\n","The non-profit Los Angeles radio station dublab has created a playlist especially for the exhibition. It features songs from the time of that trip, as well as Bowie's once and future collaborators, including Mott the Hoople, Lou Reed, Brian Eno and Queen.\n","\"This mix offers a glimpse into what he most likely was being influenced by at that moment, and later went on to define work such as 'Low' and 'Station to Station.' With a heavy dose of Krautrock, a foot in experimental music, and a solid presence in the so-called 'glam-rock' scene of that era,\" writes Alejandro Cohen, executive director of dublab, on the museum website.\n","The exhibition of MacCormack's photos is completed by Bowie's own 16mm film \"The Long Way Home,\" which captures several elements of the journey, including the visit to the Moscow May Day parade.\n","The photos on show are also collected in Geoff MacCormack's current book, \"David Bowie: Rock 'n' Roll with Me,\" published this year.\n","The exhibition \"David Bowie in the Soviet Union\" at the Wende Museum in Culver City, USA runs through October 22, 2023.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","\"Sudan conflict: What the 'gold of the grandmothers' symbolizes 03.07.2023\"\n","At first glance, the painting shows colorful geometric squares.

Husbands give their wives gold, which they can then pass on for several generations.\n","\"If a woman has sold her gold, then her life has reached a low point,\" Fuhrmann adds. In other words, these are the people for whom misfortune is inescapable.\n","Now, all of Sudan has sold its gold. Since mid-April, weapons have once again become the main currency in the northeast African country.\n","The power struggle between rival generals — the leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, and the de facto head of state and army, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan — has turned into a war that is dragging Sudan, as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently lamented, \"into the abyss,\" and at a rapid pace.\n","According to UN Refugee Aid, more than 500,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, while more than two million people have been displaced within the country. \n","\"With the show, we want to draw more attention to the situation in Sudan again,\" says Fuhrmann, \"We're making a sign of solidarity to support the artists who are in exile or still on the ground.\"\n","It's a goal shared by the project's supporters and funders — the Khartoum Downtown Gallery, the (currently closed) Goethe-Institut Sudan, the Goethe-Institut in Exile and the Goethe-Institut Bonn.\n","The exhibition features works by Amna Elhassan, who was also recently invited to put on a large solo show at Frankfurt's Schirn Gallery, along with art by Khalid Adelrahman, Reem Aljeally, Ala Kheir, Hashim Nasr, Waleed Mohammed and Mohammed Ohaj.\n","Some of the artists are making their first appearance here in Germany, for some it's even the first time in Europe.

The scene of brutal fighting for the first time included the long-spared capital, Khartoum. \"Rapid Support Forces fighters are entering homes and stealing residents' gold,\" Fuhrmann says. She speaks of a \"new level of violence.\"\n","An improvised-looking pencil drawing by artist and architect Reem Aljeally, a student of the more famous Amna Elhassan, sums up the situation in her country: It shows a hand reaching into a wide-open backpack.

A mountain of potatoes is piled up in front of us.\n","Timotic has time, as well as a potato peeler. He will sit at this table for six hours a day until July 9, peeling potatoes and singing opera arias (a self-contained piece for solo voice, usually accompanied by orchestra). He invites the audience at the Museum Folkwang to sit with him, listen and take up the potato peeler themselves.\n","\"Are you hungry?\" is the name of the performance, which Timotic also describes as a gift of love to the audience.\n","He doesn't know yet whether he will last the six hours, he says. But Marina Abramovic has taught him to believe in himself. For a year, the globally renowned, New York-based artist taught the students via numerous Zoom conferences, but also during personal meetings to prepare the performances.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Abramovic put her students through a tough schooling, including a one-week \"Cleaning the House\" workshop in Greece.\n","\"Cleaning the house\" is to endure physical privations as a means get to know oneself better. This training camp lasted seven days.\n","\"Five days of it, there is no eating, talking is forbidden. Instead we do physical exercises to understand what time is, what presence means, and afterwards we worked on what can now be seen here as a result,\" explained Abramovic.\n","The six hours that her students now perform every day at the Museum Folkwang in Essen is not comparable to her own dedication, however.\n","Abramovic became famous for sitting on a chair for 600 hours for her retrospective \"The Artist is Present,\" at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 2010. For over three months, she invited people to take turns sitting opposite her while staring into her eyes without speaking or making physical contact.\n","The 76-year-old Abramovic herself can only watch the performances live on screen.

In her performance, she also reflects on the pressure of being a musician.\n","\"Especially string players, when they don't do something well they always want to punish themselves, because perfectionism is so strong in this profession, including me,\" she says.\n","Like Radovanovic, most of the other performers do not come from the visual arts, but are singer, directors, dancers or photographers.

Cello, brass, flutes and the Indian swarmandal (a harp, or plucked box zither) were thrown into the mix. \n","The song was released as a flipside to the band's \"Penny Lane\" vinyl take.\n","\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" confounded band critics and fans alike but would ultimately shape the emerging psychedelic rock genre. Its accompanying promotional film is considered a pioneer in the music video medium getting off the ground at the time.\n","Originally writing the song on a film set in Almeria, Spain in September-October 1966, Lennon was allegedly influenced by his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD while penning \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\" Likewise, the line \"Nothing is real\" reflects the concept of illusion conveyed in the Hindu teachings Lennon was reading at the time.\n","According to music magazine Rolling Stone, Lennon considered \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" to be his greatest work.\n","Following Lennon's murder in New York City in December 1980, a tribute to the Beatles' co-founder was created in the Big Apple's Central Park – the Strawberry Fields Memorial – not far from the Dakota Building, where Lennon resided with his wife and artist, Yoko Ono, and where the songwriter was killed.\n","Meanwhile, the strawberry has also emerged as a sensuous and sometimes erotic symbol in art and pop culture. \n","Take the 1990 film \"Pretty Woman\" starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, in which client Edward (Gere) offers up champagne and strawberries to call girl Vivian (Roberts) in a provocative scene in a swanky hotel. Vivian indulges in a sumptuous bite, yet retorts that this art of seduction won't work on her. She's too smart for that.\n","Why is it that the strawberry can be taken for sexual innuendo? What is it about the fruit that is so alluring?\n","The strawberry as a sexy symbol goes back to the Romans, Maitri Chand, a Mumbai-based psychologist and marriage therapist, told Cosmopolitan magazine in February 2023. \n","\"Strawberries as fruit have been historically associated with Venus, the goddess for love, sex, beauty, and fertility. They were also offered to people who were getting married as a gift to increase sexual pleasure.\" This was due to their bright red color, intoxicating taste and tempting fragrance.\n","Wild strawberries are mentioned in the works of ancient Romans and praised as a gift of the gods. Poet Ovid distinguished between the ground tree strawberry, while fellow poet Virgil offered a warning to children picking strawberries to beware of serpents lurking in the grass.\n","Fast-forward to the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and you'll find the strawberry symbollically invoked throughout the works of William Shakespeare.\n","In the 19th century, the fruit featured in fairy tales by the German Brothers Grimm, including \"The Three Little Men in the Woods\" and \"The Hazel Branch.\"\n","Charles Baudelaire, in his poem \"Les metamorphoses du vampire,\" describes a woman's mouth as \"red as strawberries.\" \n","German poet Paul Zech's 1930 \"Ich bin so wild nach deinem Erdbeermund\" (I'm so wild about your strawberry mouth), on the other hand, was a more pornographic verse about things below the beltline. The image has inspired songs by bands such as Franz Ferdinand, as well as providing the title to famous German actor Klaus Kinski's autobiography.\n","Alpine strawberries featured in religious paintings beginning in the late 1300s, and were often associated with the Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus. \n","These include \"Madonna Among the Strawberries,\" painted around 1420, and the 15th century \"Madonna with Wild Strawberry,” where the fruit and its flower paradoxically symbolize both maternity and virginity.\n","The motif of the strawberry is found in paintings by artists ranging from Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai to Russian Zinaida Serebriakova, to Auguste Renoir and Marc Chagall.\n","British artist Lucian Freud created this 1950s work, aptly titled \"Strawberries,” as a gift to Ann Rothermere, who was Freud's patron and friend. It reflects both his fascination with the Old Masters, as well as the intensity of the strawberry imagery.\n","Equally riveting is the triptych oil painting on oak panel \"The Garden of Earthy Delights” by Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, who lived from approximately 1450 to 1516.\n","The viewer detects the strawberry as the pinnacle in a surrealistic castle, while tiny people sit in a circle holding up the gigantic red fruit as several naked subjects are ensconced within an open strawberry.\n","The work typically relates themes if sensuality, desire and \"earthly delights” to the strwaberry, which is housed in Madrid's Museo Nacional del Prado.\n","People had been eating the much smaller, wild strawberries for thousands of years (and not just red ones, but white and yellow sorts as well), often for what were considered medicinal purposes. \n","However, strawberries were not earnestly cultivated until the 1300s in Europe.\n","By the early 1700s, as world exploration and colonization expanded, travelers brought back plant and animal samples to Europe from all over the world. In the US, for instance, Native Americans had been enjoying strawberries for centuries.\n","It was a stroke of luck that strawberry samples that French naval engineer Amedee-Francois Frezier had transplanted to France from an expedition to Chile in 1712 were later crossbred with a variety brought back from Virginia, USA. This gave birth to a hybrid that would lay the foundation for the much larger, plump, heart-shaped garden strawberry we know and love today.\n","In May 2023, German environmental activists from the Campact group petitioned strawberry cultivation practices in Huelva, Spain, saying that strawberry farms close to the Donana national park had been illegally diverting water in order to irrigate their crops all year round. The environmentalists called on German supermarkets to stop selling these \"drought strawberries.\"\n","Campact's petition stated that \"illegal water theft\" was threatening the \"fragile ecosystem\" of Donana national park.\n","Huelva, where the park is located, typically produces around 30% of the EU's crop.\n","The region is the largest exporter of strawberries in the world, a large volume of which goes to Germany.\n","Yet the love affair with the strawberry — which is a member of the rose family, high in vitamin C and is not actually a berry, but what botanists call a \"false fruit\" — is not likely to end anytime soon.\n","Legend has it that, in the French countryside, people served up cold strawberry soup as an aphrodisiac to newlyweds.\n","Old folklore also says that if two people break a strawberry in half and share it with each other, they will fall in love. \n","\n","\"Have China's security laws changed Hong Kong forever? 30.06.2023\"\n","Three years after the controversial national security law came into effect in Hong Kong, previously known for its high level of autonomy and civil liberty, the city looks and feels very different.\n","Since 2020, more than 100 people have been arrested and imprisoned under national security charges, several pro-democracy political parties and large civic organizations have disbanded, and books and movies considered sensitive have been censored.\n","In the latest case, Hong Kong's Department of Justice attempted to ban a popular protest song from being circulated online.\n","Hong Kong's Beijing-aligned authorities maintain the law has brought \"stability\" back to the territory following the months-long citywide protest in 2019.\n","Some Hong Kong activists abroad, however, told DW the law has \"completely destroyed\" all forms of freedom and most civil liberties.\n","\"We've lost our freedom in the parliament, we've lost our freedom in the judiciary, we have lost the freedom in choosing the chief executive, all forms of protests are now criminalized, and even soft expressions like movies and arts are now banned under the law,” said Ted Hui, a former pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong who now lives in exile in Australia.\n","\n","The dramatic changes that sent shock waves across Hong Kong began with the arrest and detention of prominent political and civil society figures, including 47 pro-democracy activists and prominent media leaders like Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai.\n","The crackdown expanded to other realms of civil society, including the forced closure of pro-democracy media outlets such as Apple Daily and the Stand News, and the removal of books on sensitive topics like the Tiananmen Square Massacre.\n","\"This crackdown is a secondary-level autocratization that targets civil society and infiltrates everyday life,\" said Maggie Shum, a political scientist at Behrend College at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). \n","Kenneth Chan, an expert in politics at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), told DW that activities such as commemorating the Tiananmen Massacre or raising funds for NGOs or political groups have been banned.\n","\"Hong Kong authorities have introduced new red lines to further strengthen control over all aspects of the city,\" said Chan.\n","Despite widespread criticism of the law, Hong Kong's justice minister Paul Lam said in a recent interview that the law hasn't affected citizens' freedom of assembly.\n","Last month, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee also refused to clarify whether attending June 4th commemoration events would violate the law or not. \"Everybody should act in accordance with the law and think of what they do, so as to be ready to face the consequences,\" Lee said during a regular press briefing.\n","With rights and freedoms that used to be guaranteed under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" vanishing rapidly in Hong Kong, Chan from HKBU said the current process is Hong Kong's \"second return\" to China.\n","In 1997, Hong Kong was handed over back to China by the United Kingdom. \n","According to Chan, key institutions in Hong Kong are being stacked with pro-Beijing members, while the city's judicial system, which has long been known for its independence, is coming under increasing pressure.\n","\"We are losing checks and balances and democratic guardrails that formerly existed in Hong Kong, and instead, there are more top-down networks,\" he told DW.\n","In 2021, Hong Kong approved amendments to its electoral system that allow pro-Beijing institutions to appoint most of the legislators while requiring all candidates to go through a vetting process controlled by a pro-government committee.\n","In April, the Hong Kong government announced that the electoral overhaul would be extended to the district council, where most seats are chosen through direct election.\n","On the judicial front, the law has allowed national security cases to be heard by government-appointed judges. The legislative council passed an amendment in May to grant the Hong Kong government the power to ban overseas lawyers from handling national security cases.\n","Shum from Penn State said China's \"hard-line campaign\" to crush any sign of dissent in Hong Kong has been \"very successful.\"\n","\"The Hong Kong government is now saying they want to plug the legal holes that exist in the law by passing Article 23 in the Basic Law,\" she told DW, adding that such a move would stamp out any form of collective actions to regain control in Hong Kong.\n","Last week, Chief Executive Lee told a local media outlet that Article 23 would be enacted in 2023 or 2024 at the latest.\n","\"With this legislation, I hope the entire process will consist of careful and thorough considerations, resulting in a successful law,\" he told Hong Kong China News Agency.\n","The Hong Kong diaspora community has also become targets of crackdowns under the law. In April, a 23-year-old university student, who normally studies in Japan, was arrested over posts she shared on social media, which Hong Kong police described as \"inciting Hong Kong independence.\"\n","\n","Exiled Hong Kong activist Hui told DW that the incident has sparked widespread fear within the diaspora community, as overseas Hong Kongers begin to realize the potential risk of being arrested when they return to the semi-autonomous city.\n","\"Nowadays, when Hong Kong people talk about returning to the city, they will talk about the potential risk of being arrested or having their passports confiscated by authorities,\" he said, adding that most Hong Kong people abroad will adopt precautions such as bringing spare phones when they are returning to the city.\n","Despite some overseas organizations' efforts to help sustain the resistance in Hong Kong, Shum from Penn State said the national security law is aimed at severing ties between the diaspora community and Hong Kong.\n","\"I feel that in the long run, Hong Kong is going to become more isolated,\" she told DW.\n","Edited by Sou-Jie van Brunnersum\n","'Arnold Schwarzenegger biography hits the shelves 29.06.2023'\n","\"Arnold,\" a new two-volume biography of Arnold Schwarzenegger by Dian Hanson, tells the life of the Austrian-born star in four parts: as an athlete, actor, American and activist.\n","To be published by Taschen Verlag on July 7,  the biography of the Hollywood star was presented to the public for the first time on June 28 at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.\n","The work will be available in three editions, all limited, with exclusive interviews and never-before-published pictures.\n","While the collector's edition is the most affordable version at  €1,250 ($1,364), the 100 copies of the Annie Leibovitz Art Edition will sell for €12,500 each.\n","Only 1947 copies of the various editions will be sold in total, to celebrate the year Arnold Schwarzenegger was born.\n","Arnie, as he is affectionately known, was born on July 30, 1947, in Thal in the Austrian region of Styria. As a child, he was active in sports, including soccer, boxing and swimming.\n","At age 15, he first entered a weightlifting studio. Over the next few years, the young Schwarzenegger would spend most of his time fine-tuning his muscles.\n","\"You have to train each muscle individually. It's like the precise work of a sculptor who works on marble with a hammer and chisel — not exactly like Rodin, but similar,\" Schwarzenneger told the German weekly Die Zeit in 2012.\n","In 1967, he became the youngest Mr. Universe. Starting in 1970, he earned the Mr. Olympia title — the most important bodybuilding award — six times in a row. He readily admits that he took steroids, adding that they weren't banned at the time.\n","When Schwarzenegger immigrated to the US in 1968, his impressive appearance soon caught the attention of the film industry. Known under his stage name, Arnold Strong, he got his first role in 1969 in \"Hercules in New York.\"\n","At the same time, Schwarzenegger also found his way into the art scene and got to know Pop Art icon Andy Warhol. \"He was fascinated by my energy and my strength,\" the bodybuilder told Die Zeit. \"I worked as a model for him, and he introduced me to other artists like Jamie Wyeth and Laraine Newman.\"\n","Schwarzenegger also recalled how Warhol introduced him to producers, fundraisers and actors like James Caan, Woody Allen and other influential people like Jackie Kennedy. Years later, Schwarzenegger would become part of the Kennedy family himself when he married Maria Shriver, the niece of former US President John F. Kennedy, in 1986.\n","Now well-connected, his film career took off in 1977. Schwarzenegger surprised critics by winning a Golden Globe for Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture for his bodybuilder docudrama \"Pumping Iron.\"\n","In 1982, he became famous as \"Conan the Barbarian,\" and in 1984 he was offered the main role in a B-movie called \"The Terminator,\" which, in Schwarzenegger's own words, was \"a big challenge\" for him. Thanks to his convincing performance as the android killer, the low-budget production by director James Cameron quickly rose to cult status.\n","By then, Schwarzenegger was in high demand, and his earnings continued to rise. From the late 1980s until the early 1990s, he enjoyed a great deal of commercial success not only with action movies, but also with comedies like \"Twins\" and \"Kindergarten Cop\" alongside Danny DeVito.\n","Nevertheless, the hype had ebbed. After his third performance as \"The Terminator\" in 2003, Schwarzenegger said farewell to the film world and launched his third career, this time as a politician.\n","When he ran for governor in California in 2003, he brought along the sword he used to carry as \"Conan the Barbarian\" to Sacramento, presenting himself as the strong man the state needed to rescue it from heavy debt, while calling his political opponents wimps.\n","It took him a while, however, to get used to his new profession as governor. \"As an actor, you can rely on the screenplay, but a politician doesn't have one. Every day, every hour, it's incredible how many problems you're faced with — social welfare, poverty and overflowing jails. You wake up in the morning to 2,000 bush fires in California, or somebody is sitting in a prison cell waiting to be executed at midnight, and you get a call, saying, 'Governor, you could stop it,'\" he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in 2013.\n","Schwarzenegger, a Republican, is a supporter of the death penalty and turned down two pardon opportunities as governor before lethal injection was declared unconstitutional in California in 2006, effectively ending capital punishment in the state.\n","Following his two terms, he returned to familiar terrain and filmed yet another edition of \"Terminator\" in 2015.\n","A vocal critic of former President Donald Trump, Schwarzenegger took over the former president's casting show, \"The Apprentice,\" in January 2017, but dropped it after one season due to bad ratings.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","But only one role has not been enough for the former politician for a long time. Above all, Arnold Schwarzenegger has made the fight against climate change his mission. In his speeches, such as at this year's Austrian World Summit, an annual climate conference in Vienna co-hosted by his Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative platform, he focuses on new technologies and urges a shift away from fossil fuels.\n","\"We have blood on our hands,\" the ex-bodybuilder has said of Europe financing Moscow's war of aggression in Ukraine with its billions in payments to Russia for oil and gas imports.\n","He also doesn't mince words when criticizing politicians in his own country. In an emotional video released immediately after the storming of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Schwarzenegger called Trump a liar, a coup plotter and a failed leader.\n","\"He will go down in history as the worst president ever,\" he said. He added, however, that America will come back stronger \"because we now understand what we have to lose.\"\n","Austrian-born Schwarzenegger has come to represent the embodiment of the American dream like few Europeans before him.

The last one he did manage to complete, however, has become a collector's item.\n","\"Dame mit Fächer\" (\"Lady with a Fan\"), a painting of an unnamed woman, was still on an easel in Klimt's studio when the artist succumbed to a stroke and pneumonia.\n","The prized item went under the hammer at Sotheby's Modern & Contemporary Evening Auction in London on Tuesday. Other artworks for sale the same evening included pieces by Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet, but both were  dwarfed in price by Klimt's portrait.\n","Even before the hammer fell, the estimated price tag made the work \"the most valuable ever to have been offered at auction in Europe,\" according to Sotheby's.\n","Other Klimt works have sold for more, however, including his 1907 painting, \"Water Serpents II,\" which reportedly went for $170 million in 2015 in a private sale.\n","\n","\"It shows Klimt at the very height of his creative prowess, drawing on imagery from Asia, of which he was obsessed,\" Helena Newman, chairman of Sotheby's Europe and worldwide head of impressionist and modern art, told the news agency Reuters.\n","Newman highlighted depictions of a phoenix, lotus flower and other elements in the painting, adding: \"It's very rare for a Klimt painting of this quality and caliber of a portrait of a woman to come to auction.\"\n","The Sotheby's website is no less effusive about Klimt and his work.\n","\"Gustav Klimt’s beguiling representations of women have made him the most celebrated painter of the female portrait in the early twentieth century.

The paintings he completed around 1900 for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna were criticized for being pornographic.\n","University officials took offence at the amount of naked skin on show in Klimt's works, leading him to eventually withdraw from the project entirely.\n","Klimt never accepted public contracts again, and insisted on only painting for private clients.\n","A painting that had vanished in 1997 was discovered in the walls of the very gallery it was stolen from in 2019.

It was one of the largest slave ports in the world.\n","From the concept to planning and finally the opening ceremony on June 22, completing this important cultural space took 20 years — due in part to funding issues, the pandemic and structural problems.\n","IAAM opens to the public on June 27, 2023.\n","The International African American Museum does not present a chronology of events but is designed to \"simultaneously hold the sensations of trauma and joy,\" explained museum director, Tonya Matthews.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Permanent exhibits, dozens of artifacts and more than 30 works of art honor the many thousands of Africans who were forced to leave their homes under barbaric conditions.

Some slaves were just toddlers when they were forced to make the perilous journey from West Africa crammed into a ship's hold. Many did not survive the grueling journey.\n","One room over, names are also engraved on walls such as Linda, David and Hardtimes, even if these were the names the slaves were given upon arrival. The names were found in the freight and sales records kept at Gadsden's Wharf, which was built in the 1760s by then-Governor, Christopher Gadsden.\n","An estimated 100,000 slaves are said to have arrived there.

Like a chameleon, it can go undetected, adapt to its surroundings, become invisible. And, of course, it's also used in the arts.\n","The virtually rotproof material's boom in the arts scene came in the 1960s, but it had already inspired avant-garde movements in Paris decades earlier.\n","The first sculpture made of plastic was created in 1916 by Russian sculptor Naum Gabo: \"Tete No.2\" (\"Constructed Head No.2\") a cubist head made of rhodoid, a cellulose acetate plastic used to make dolls and billiard balls.\n","But not all plastics are the same. When Plexiglas, also known as acrylic, came out in the 1930s, new possibilities emerged, including for artists.\n","Bauhaus and other artistic movements of the era experimented with transparency and reflections.\n","The artists of the Zero group, including Otto Piene and Heinz Mack, benefited from the possibilities this new plastic offered in the late 1950s, experimenting with plastic films to produce their light sculptures. Any material was fine for his art, said Mack. But when designers also started using plastic for furniture in pop colors, he lost interest.\n","Plastic — whether hard or flexible, transparent, opaque, patterned, smooth, delicate or bursting with color — then appeared in various art forms and movements, including in pop art.\n","John de Andrea's 1978 female plastic nude sculpture \"Woman Leaning against the Wall\" is so realistic you want to reach out and touch her to confirm it's just a sculpture.\n","The boundaries between art and fashion blurred. Thomas Bayrle, an artist from the German city of Frankfurt, worked with a fashion studio to design plastic coats that were later sold at the Kaufhof department store chain for 25.50 Deutsche Marks (about €12, or $13).\n","Niki de Saint Phalle, famous for her gigantic \"Nanas,\" also gave in to the pull of plastic. In 1968 she created inflatable balloon Nanas. As beach toys, people could take them along on a vacation.\n","French Nouveau Realisme artists such as Christo & Jeanne-Claude, Cesar and Arman, were among the first to create artworks criticizing plastic as a symbol of consumerism and the throwaway society.\n","Arman created trash objects called \"Poubelles\" (Trash cans) in which he squeezed lots of plastic trash into a display case. \"As a witness to this society, I have always been intensely concerned with the pseudo-biological cycle of production, consumption and destruction,\" Arman said in 1973, adding that he was long been troubled by the fact that \"one of the most obvious concrete consequences of this cycle is to flood our world with junk and surplus rejects.\" His words sound downright visionary today.\n","Arman's colorful hodgepodge of \"Poubelles\" was intended to contrast with the enthusiastic use of plastic in pop art. For example, US artist Claes Oldenburg created XXL soft sculptures meant to represent everyday objects. He used rigid polyurethane foam, a new material that came onto the market in the 1960s and excited the art world.\n","Lynda Benglis, another US sculptor, was on a different path, expanding the boundaries between painting and sculpture by \"painting\" with latex and pigments. Her sculptural \"Pools\" have an undulating, organic form that almost seems to be alive because of the flow and movement of the plastic. Benglis also created a series of works in molded polyurethane foam and plasticized paper.\n","The sculptures of Berlin-based artist Berta Fischer, born in 1973, are all about transparency and lightness. She creates ephemeral installations out of plastic foils, nylon threads or acrylic glass, with brightly colored, reflective or transparent surfaces that appear to be classy and cheap at the same time.\n","The \"Plastic World\" exhibition at Frankfurt's Schirn Kunsthalle museum, which runs until October 1, 2023, presents art ranging from the euphoria of pop culture to the futuristic influence of the space age and the trash works of Nouveau Realisme to contemporary eco-critical works.\n","The exhibition shows the allure of plastic and its drawbacks, emphasizing how ambivalent the material can be. Plastic is a curse and a blessing; it is indestructible, just like the concept of art itself.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'Yoga instructor sets out to decolonize yoga in Germany 21.06.2023'\n","\"Something is wrong here,\" Sangeeta Lerner thought to herself when she walked into a German yoga studio for the first time about a decade ago. Lerner had just moved from India to Berlin and wanted to get back to practicing yoga.\n","But her thoughts floundered in the Berlin studio: Why is the yoga instructor so fit? Why is the room decorated with a mix of Buddhist and Hindu gods that belong in a temple? And why was there superficial techno music playing during the final relaxation phase known as the shavasana?\n","\"Everything was so sterile and fancy. Everyone had gym clothes on, while I had come in comfy clothes. The yoga teacher walked around the room correcting the asanas (or postures),\" Lerner recalls. She was irritated that she felt disconnected from the teacher and the other practitioners, since yoga stands for a sense of community. Lerner thought she was doing something wrong, that she was not flexible enough and that she needed more practice.\n","Today, ten years later, the 44-year-old knows she's not doing anything wrong, just like the approximately three million Germans who practice yoga regularly. Because it's not about right or wrong — it's about awareness.\n","\"Yoga is not a sport, it doesn't matter what kind of body you have. Yoga is healing work — accessible to everyone. And for that, there must be spaces where everyone can feel welcome,\" Sangeeta Lerner tells DW.\n","Originating from India, yoga is closely linked to Hindu philosophy and practice. In western societies however, yoga is often taken out of context and commercialized.\n","Lerner sees this as cultural appropriation. Under British rule yoga was forbidden. Now sacred symbols and practices are unconsciously appropriated and dissociated from their Indian origins.\n","Sometimes everyday life doesn't provide enough opportunities to laugh, so laughing yoga makes up for that. The course starts with a rather artificial laughing exercise consisting of \"hohoho\" and \"hahaha.\" Real giggling is supposed to automatically ensue. Laughing yoga, which eases tensions and strengthens the immune system, is the easiest form of yoga — and is a good option for beginners.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Yoga, as it is taught in the west, is mostly limited to the physical aspect of asanas or postures. There are also some bizarre forms such as beer yoga, yoga with goats or yoga on a stand-up paddleboard, which often includes the chanting of \"om.\" Western yoga studios mostly mix esoteric ideas, far eastern philosophy and western psychology. Buddha is mixed haphazardly with religious songs of Shakti and Shiva which are Hindu gods.\n","\"I'm not a Buddhist,\" Lerner explains, \"but these spiritual symbols are very meaningful to people in Asia.\"\n","She observes how cultures are imitated yet not integrated in western yoga studios. It reminds her more of a kind of art performance. \"That's when colonial supremacy comes into play. You take something from a culture and make it work for you.\"\n","Sangeeta Lerner was born and raised in Mumbai, India. The family didn't have much money, lived in a small apartment, and yet Lerner found her mother in particular to be a happy person. \n","\"My mother always gave everything. She welcomed everyone to our home and when she was out, she always had cookies for the street dogs. That was yoga for me. Not just physical exercise. My mother was very spiritual without being dogmatic. We all felt how good it was for her to give to others.\" This feeling, she says, is what she misses in Germany and now wants to pass on herself as a yoga teacher.\n","Lerner used to work as a copywriter in the advertising industry. Among others, she worked for three years in Bahrain. This is where she met her future German husband, who worked in marketing. \"When I gave presentations, the men never gave me credit for my ideas. That's when I realized that as an Indian woman, I have no power in this country.\"\n","She had always been someone who fought against social injustices, she says. To deal with all the chaos around her, including discrimination in her own country, she long sought answers in yoga.\n","Yoga is an Indian practice believed to be about 3,000 years old. The word yoga derives from Sanskrit and broadly means \"to unite.\" It is an interplay of body, mind and breath, combining physical exercises, breathing techniques, meditation and ethical principles. So, it's no surprise to Lerner that yoga has become an export hit. \"It just works,\" she says with a knowing smile. \"Anyone who decides to become a yoga teacher isn't doing it to make money or become famous. They've realized it's a powerful practice that brings you closer to your soul.\" It was also the reason why she turned her back on the advertising industry.\n","The global yoga industry generates €35 billion (almost $38 billion) from classes, retreats, yoga gear, books, magazines and scented sticks, according to market research firm Allied Market Research.\n","Yoga in the west is often advertised by predominantly slender, white people. This reinforces stereotypical ideas and excludes people who do not conform to this beauty norm.\n","Yogini Sangeeta Lerner bought her first yoga mat in Germany. After numerous further training courses, she gathered the courage to offer her own yoga classes. However, not in a yoga studio, but in a family center and in a midwife's practice.\n","She shows up wearing loose colorful pants and a blouse. Again and again, she directs her attention to the breathing, and asanas happen as if in passing. She keeps the exercises simple without contortions. A meditative state is quickly attained.\n","Although people worldwide follow the spiritual practice and appreciate it, the Berlin-based yoga teacher is annoyed that it doesn't help to prevent prejudices against Indians.\n","\"I still get the stereotypes of cows in the street or snake charmers,\" she says. Her two children also have had racist experiences, she says. \"India is a big country and we also have many political problems. But instead of talking about it, we keep getting pigeonholed.\"\n","To change that, Sangeeta Lerner has been giving Decolonize Yoga workshops throughout Germany for the past two years where they learn how to teach yoga without being culturally appropriative. Both experienced yoga teachers and beginners attend these two-day workshops.\n","\"Are you taking yoga away from us now?\" is one of the questions Lerner often hears. \"Of course not!\" is her answer. As someone who grew up with it, she mainly wants to create awareness of its complexity and pass on its cultural roots.\n","\"We all live in toxic cultures, whether in Germany or India,\" Lerner says. Her aim is to bring yoga out of the privileged, commercialized environment and into the mainstream. She has already succeeded on a small scale. She is nicknamed the 'Mayor of the Schillerkiez' in her neighborhood, Berlin's Neukölln district, where everyone knows and greets her. There's a sense of community, just like she learned from her mother.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","\"10 things about the Titanic you probably didn't know 21.06.2023\"\n","Many myths and legends have circled around the Titanic up to this day, contributing to an ongoing fascination for the wreck. For decades, it has also drawn wealthy tourists to travel to the remains of the liner for themselves — an expedition that is not only expensive, but also dangerous, and now a submersible vessel carrying five people has gone missing.\n","\n","The RMS Titanic was supposed to be a triumph of engineering. Built in Belfast, the ship was the largest in the world in its day. In 1912, the luxury liner set out on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City. People had clamored to reserve places onboard.\n","The prices of first-class tickets varied, with the cheapest costing 30 pounds, the equivalent of about €4,000 ($4,330) today. Many of the guests could certainly afford it — wealthy passengers included real estate mogul and hotel owner John Jacob Astor, one of the richest men in the world at the time, as well as businessman Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress. They all wanted to make history as the first passengers on the Titanic.\n","Others saw the crossing as a chance to find a better life in North America. Little did anyone know, the Titanic would never reach its final destination. On the night of April 14, 1912, the steamer hit an iceberg, and the maiden voyage ended in disaster.\n","Here are 10 facts about the Titanic you might have missed.\n","On the fateful night of April 14, sailor Frederick Fleet was on lookout duty. He was an experienced sailor who had been sailing since the age of 12. It is said to have been bitterly cold in the crow's nest that night when Fleet saw a dark mass in the water — the first spotting of the iceberg — and reported the danger to his superiors. The first officer responded promptly, but it was too late.\n","Fleet survived the disaster and later stated for the record that he had not had binoculars. The binoculars were in a locked cabinet, and the keys had been left with an officer who was not onboard the ship. Part of the crew had been replaced shortly before the first Atlantic crossing, and this officer was among those replaced. He must have forgotten to leave the key on the ship.\n","Once the Titanic hit the iceberg and it was clear the ship would sink, chaos reigned, and the air was filled with fear and the screams of passengers scrambling to board lifeboats.\n","The liner's musicians, however, decided to play on the deck of the luxury liner. For more than two hours after the collision, the band was still trying to calm down the frightened people onboard. All eight musicians lost their lives in the accident. This moving gesture by the band can be seen in director James Cameron's 1997 cult film \"Titanic.\"\n","None of the engineers on the Titanic survived. Captain Edward John Smith is said to have encouraged his crew with the words, \"Be British, boys, be British.\"\n","Other men, including from the first class, also preferred to die with honor. Businessman Benjamin Guggenheim is reported to have said, \"We've dressed up in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen.\" Real estate mogul John Jacob Astor also is said to have wryly remarked, \"I asked for ice, but now this is ridiculous.\" He helped a young woman and a child emigrant into a lifeboat.\n","Of the approximately 2,240 passengers, only 700 survived the disaster.\n","The sea that night had a temperature of around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), a temperature in which a person could normally only survive for a maximum of 15 minutes.\n","Charles Joughin, the chief baker on the Titanic, is one of the most famous survivors of the disaster. Although he was chosen as the captain of one of the lifeboats, he decided to give up his place since there were already sailors on the lifeboat to steer it.\n","Joughin went down with the sinking ship but drank so much alcohol beforehand that he no longer felt the cold of the water in which he floated. After spending two hours swimming in the water, he was pulled onto an overturned lifeboat and was eventually picked up by a rescue ship.\n","The love story of Rose and Jack featured in James Cameron's \"Titanic\" is pure fiction. But there were lovers on the Titanic who suffered a tragic end.\n","One example is the co-owner of the American department store Macy's and his wife: Isidor and Ida Straus. They had spent the winter in Europe and were on their way back home to New York. Both were offered a seat in a lifeboat, but Isidor refused — as long as children and women were still on the sinking ship, he did not want to get on.\n","His wife Ida, in turn, did not want to be rescued without her husband and is reported to have said, \"I will not be separated from my husband. As we have lived, so will we die, together.\" Several plaques commemorate the couple who chose to share death, including one at Macy's department store in New York City.\n","The ship should have had 32 lifeboats, and while the initial designer planned for this, the shipping company was convinced that the liner was safe and that having more lifeboats would just needlessly take up space on the decks. On a ship like this, comfort was of the utmost importance.\n","The company actually did not violate any safety laws, because according to the regulations of the time, the number of boats was based on the weight of the ship, not on the number of passengers. It was a fatal calculation. With the 16 lifeboats and four folding boats that were onboard, only 700 people could be rescued.\n","Perhaps before naming the steamer Titanic, the White Star Line shipping company should have read author Morgan Robertson's book \"Futility,\" published in 1898.\n","The novel told the story of a large and luxurious ship called the Titan that hits an iceberg while sailing between the US and England — just like the Titanic in real life.\n","Many individuals set out to find the sunken Titanic, but it was not until 73 years after the disaster, in 1985, that underwater archaeologist Robert Ballard succeeded in locating the wreck in the North Atlantic and photographing it for the first time. He financed this endeavor by agreeing to search for the remains of two sunken submarines in a secret US Navy mission. He then had 12 days in which he was allowed to use Navy equipment to find the Titanic.\n","At a depth of 3,800 meters (12,470 feet), in eternal darkness, he found the wreck of the former luxury liner. The find came just in time, as microbes had already settled onto the shipwreck and begun decomposing the Titanic piece by piece; it will eventually become dust. Scientists suspect that the wreck will be gone by 2030. Yet the legend will certainly remain.\n","The best-known film adaptation of the Titanic story is probably James Cameron's 1997 box-office hit. The film is considered one of the most successful films in movie history — it won 11 Oscars.\n","But there were also other film adaptations. The first was made in 1912, the same year the steamer went down. It was entitled \"Saved From the Titanic,\" and the main role was played by a survivor of the disaster.\n","A Titanic film was also made in Germany during World War II, but the Nazis used this film version as a propaganda tool against the US and the United Kingdom.\n","Since 1912, many passenger ships have cruised the Atlantic, and the Titanic has long since been overtaken in size by countless other vessels. The largest cruise ship, launched in 2022, is called Wonder of the Seas. It has a width of 66 meters (216 feet), compared to the Titanic's 28 meters. There is also a clear difference in height: the Wonder of the Seas measures 72.5 meters and the Titanic just 53 meters.\n","\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'Bach Festival 2023: Cantatas for eternity 19.06.2023'\n","When Johann Sebastian Bach took over as Thomaskantor in Leipzig in 1723, he wrote his most beautiful cantatas for church services. He would never have dreamed that this \"everyday music\" would one day become pieces for eternity.\n","To commemorate Bach's 300th anniversary as church cantor, the cantatas were the focus of the Leipzig Bach Festival, which was held from June 8-18. \n","Under the motto \"Bach for Future,\" more than 70,000 visitors from 56 countries came — a new international record for the festival, which scores points for its original venues from Bach's time. \"The more international the festival, the younger the audience,\" Bach festival director Michael Maul told DW. \"I am therefore not worried about the future of his music. Bach is present all over the world and attracts people to Leipzig like never before.\"\n","To close the festival, Bach's acclaimed Mass in B minor was heard in St. Thomas Church, performed by the Bach Collegium Japan, under the direction of Masaaki Suzuki.\n","In 2015, Bach's personal handwritten manuscript of the mass held by the Berlin State Library was included in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, a project to protect and preserve culturally significant documents and manuscripts.\n","Johann Sebastian Bach came to Leipzig at the age of 38 as the new Thomaskantor and municipal music director. He not only composed church cantatas for Sunday services, but also directed the \"Thomanerchor\" (St. Thomas Boys' choir), which was founded in 121 and remains one of the most famous boys' choirs in Germany. Bach also oversaw the maintenance of the instruments and played at weddings and funeral services.\n","In his first year of office, Bach invested much energy into his cantatas.\n","At the Bach Festival, four of the best Bach connoisseurs performed favorite cantatas with their ensembles, including conductors Philippe Herreweghe and Ton Koopman, who are known for historical performance practice and whose concerts can be heard on the \"DW Classical Music\" YouTube channel.\n","In his music, Johann Sebastian Bach created new musical forms with unfamiliar instruments and artful sound mixtures, which today are often described as atmospheric or celestial. The composer placed particular emphasis on setting the texts and biblical words of his cantatas in a musically expressive manner.\n","\"The cantatas are perhaps Bach's most complex and difficult music to access,\" says artistic director Michael Maul. Even for Germans, he says, there are language barriers with the cumbersome baroque texts. Moreover, people are no longer as God-fearing as they were in Bach's time. \"Nevertheless, Bach is received across denominational, cultural and geographical boundaries.\"\n","Contemporaries at the time did not yet recognize Bach's genius. \"Bach is so much more difficult to play than the music of his contemporaries. It is also more complex to grasp that people back then may simply have been overwhelmed,\" Maul says.\n","Bach is also said to have expected too much of his Thomaner boys at times. He complained to the council about the caliber of the boys who had been chosen, and after a few years — also because of other differences with the city council — he increasingly turned to secular music.\n","He created instructional pieces such as \"The Art of Fugue\" (1751) and composed well-known works such as the \"Goldberg Variations\" (published in 1741), which the Armenian pianist Sergei Babayan played from memory with virtuoso precision at the Bach Festival.\n","The St. Thomas Boys Choir was in particularly high demand this year. For the opening concert, it not only performed Bach's inaugural cantata \"Die Elenden sollen essen\" (\"The miserable shall eat\"), but also a world premiere by conductor, clarinetist and composer Jörg Widmann, who took the cantata form as a basis to speak about war and the hope for peace.\n","For Thomaskantor Andreas Reize, looking back, it was the biggest challenge of the 300th anniversary celebration. \"We went beyond the limits of what we could do in the premiere, but it was an incredible experience,\" Reize says. \"It was very difficult to sing, incredible for the orchestra to play, and also for me to conduct.\"\n","The Thomaner were awarded the Bach Medal for their services to the works of Johann Sebastian Bach.\n","Among the noted guests at St. Thomas Church for the \"Boys' Choir Summit\" was English rock legend Sting, a reputed Bach lover. Bach festival director Michael Maul also happens to know that every now and then, Sting plays a few bars of Bach on his guitar.\n","Johann Sebastian Bach's inauguration in Leipzig will be celebrated throughout this year.\n","For example, the St. Thomas Boys' Choir will participate in weekly Sunday services, at which the same musical programs will be heard as in Bach's day.\n","The Bach Museum will be showing the special exhibition \"Bühne frei für Johann Sebastian Bach!\" (\"Make way for Johann Sebastian Bach!\") until March 2024. Divided into three successive parts, the exhibition will focus on Bach's church music, his music for keyboard instruments, and how subsequent generations have dealt with his music.\n","Under the motto \"Choral Total,\" the Bach Festival 2024 (June 7-16) will host Bach ensembles from around the world to sing Bach's choral cantatas from his second year in office as Thomaskantor (1724/25). In addition to German and European choirs, ensembles from the US, Japan and Malaysia, among others, are expected.

They are predominantly found in Eastern European churches. The oldest surviving examples date from the 6th-7th centuries, such as the icons that will be on display in the Louvre museum. They are considered major milestones in the history of art.\n","\"Since the start of the war, like other museums, we have been concerned to see how we can support our Ukrainian colleagues.

This is why the Louvre has created an international committee, consisting of Ukrainian scientists and renowned specialists in the field, to conduct in-depth analysis and study, shedding light on the significance of these works. \n","The art treasures were brought to France via Poland and Germany on May 10 under military escort and with help of the International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH).\n","Earlier this month, a rocket landed near the Khanenko Museum, blowing out the windows.

The remaining artworks are now at risk from temperature variations caused by power cuts. \n","The Bohdan and Varvara Khanenko Museum encompasses some 25,000 works of ancient art, Byzantine, European and Asian art. \n","Its collection owes its origin to the vision and passion of Bohdan and Varvara Khanenko, two 19th-century Ukrainian entrepreneurs, art lovers and philanthropists.\n","The couple enriched their collection over the course of four decades, traveling around the world. They made their first purchases during their honeymoon in Italy in 1874. From the very start, their desire was to assemble an eclectic collection for themselves, driven by the ultimate goal of making it accessible to as many people as possible.\n","Having survived the First and Second World Wars, the Khanenko Museum is now experiencing the third war in its history.\n","\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'Germany fails to fully confront colonial legacy in Tanzania 14.06.2023'\n","An impressive, yet painful reminder of the ups and downs of German-Tanzanian relations can be found in the Museum of Natural History in the German capital. The 150-million-year-old dinosaur skeleton — one of the tallest mounted dinosaur skeletons in the world — dominates the Berlin museum's central atrium.\n","In the early 1900s, German paleontologists and their African helpers excavated it near Tendaguru Hill, a region famous for its fossils, in the Lindi region in present-day Tanzania. The skeleton has thrilled school classes and visitors to Berlin since it was first displayed in 1937, but few are aware of its history.\n","The dinosaur is also on the travel list of Tanzanian historian Philemon Mtoi, who believes the skeleton came to Berlin illegally. \"This animal is not originated from Germany. So I think it should be displayed in its country of origin,\" Mtoi said, adding that it was one of the very special animals in the world.\n","\"It will attract a lot of people. A lot of people are coming to see the display of this animal in the Berlin museum. It does not benefit the country where it was taken first.\"\n","Since his childhood, Mtoi has heard discussions in his home country about the possible repatriation of fossils and other natural and cultural artifacts that Germany collected. \n","These are \"very important discussions,\" Mtoi told DW. Such discussions are an \"opportunity to have a dialog which will end up in a positive way,\" he said. \"But if people don't discuss, the environment will be very hostile for these two parties.\"\n","Germany has recently been trying to tackle this aspect of its colonial legacy.\n","Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock traveled to Nigeria last December to return Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. Britain colonized Nigeria until its independence on October 1, 1960. The 21 artifacts had been looted by British soldiers from the Kingdom of Benin, now in Nigeria, and were then sold to German museums. These are the first of 1,130 Benin Bronzes that Germany promised to return.\n","The German colonial government also \"stole the skeletons of thousands of the dead from cemeteries in order to measure and collect them,\" a government website admits.\n","Around 200 skulls will be returned to Tanzania, as well as more than 900 to Rwanda, which along with Burundi and small parts of northern Mozambique, made up German East Africa.\n","Historian Jürgen Zimmerer, a professor at the University of Hamburg, said he finds it interesting that after \"decades of colonial amnesia and the refusal to take colonialism, colonial violence, colonial crimes and injustice seriously,\" Germany has changed its heart.\n","\"But Germany focuses on the area of museums and art, it returns objects,\" he said. \"What it wants to avoid is recognizing the structural, racist nature of colonialism as such, because that raises very fundamental questions about reparations, about apologies.\"\n","German politician Sevim Dagdelen, a member of the opposition Left Party, also thinks Germany should be doing more to examine its legacy in East Africa between 1885 und 1918.\n","\"Anyone who, like Chancellor Olaf Scholz, proposes a new start in relations with African states mustn't try to sit out the political and legal processing of colonial crimes,\" she said.\n","Dagdelen and several other Left Party members recently submitted a parliamentary question about the reappraisal of colonial crimes in present-day Tanzania.\n","The government's response to the parliamentary question is quite concrete when it comes to artifacts: \"With regard to the repatriation of human remains and the return of cultural property, there are offers of negotiations, and the German government is in favor of a dialogue with the Tanzanian government in this regard.\"\n","One of Dagdelen's central questions, however, remains unanswered. She had asked whether German colonial troops' bloody suppression of the Maji Maji rebellion in southeastern Tanganyika could be described as genocide from today's perspective.\n","A precedent for this is Germany's official acknowledgment in 2021 that it committed genocide during its colonial occupation of Namibia when it massacred the Herero and Nama peoples in the early 1900s.\n","Between 1905 and 1907, the Germans quashed the Maji Maji uprising \"with extreme brutality, using scorched-earth tactics to starve localities into submission,\" according to the Oxford Research Encyclopedias.\n","It's thought that some 200,000 to 300,000 died from causes including battlefield deaths, livestock and food confiscation, and subsequent disease and malnutrition.\n","Some scholars have found strong evidence to support a claim of genocide in Germany's conduct in Tanzania.\n","While the German government admitted in its parliamentary answer to being aware of the nature of the Maji Maji crackdown, it dodged the question of genocide. Instead, it said it faces up to its \"moral and political responsibility\" and referred to \"trustful discussions\" with the Tanzanian government.\n","For Sevim Dagdelen, however, exploring whether a genocide took place is part of a constructive and goal-oriented dialogue. She also wants the government to learn from its mistakes in dealing with Namibia.\n","While both Germany and Namibia have made a joint declaration about the Herero and Nama genocide, the Namibian government is yet to ratify it. That's because the descendants of the genocide victims want direct reparations, rather than the €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) promised to the Namibian government.\n","\"From the beginning, the German government, in close coordination with the government of Tanzania, should also genuinely take into account the descendants of the victims or the communities particularly affected by the genocide and seek dialogue,\" Dagdelen said.\n","Historian Jürgen Zimmerer believes the German government is avoiding the issue because it is worried about setting a precedent.\n","\"People are afraid of precedents when they officially acknowledge colonial violence in connection with reparations or apologies,\" he told DW, noting that there are demands for reparations from World War II. So the outcomes of ongoing debates on recognizing colonial injustice are being watched very closely.\n","\"The German government thought it could sweep Namibia under the rug, [but] it can't do that,\" he said. \"And now, it wants to avoid a repeat of Namibia at all costs, in that it won't admit anything that in any way has similarities with Namibia — with the genocide back then — or could be construed in that way.\"\n","The Left Party's parliamentary question also raises the reparations issue. The German government's answer: There has, so far, been no official demand from the Tanzanian government.\n","Tanzanian historian Mtoi, however, said he considers it inappropriate to wait for such demands to be made. Instead, Germany should make a clear signal of reconciliation, he said, because if Berlin hesitates now, it will strain relations for years.\n","Mtoi proposes a joint commission incorporating historians and academics from the former colonial countries.\n","\"Germany is one of the strongest nations in the world,\" he said, and many countries look to it as an example. \"It is not bad to say sorry.

And so I, too, have chosen a theme that cannot be bypassed today — war.\"\n","Widmann begins with the famous 18th-century anti-war song, \"Es ist Krieg!\" (\"It is war!\") by Matthias Claudius, and weaves an intense text-music work into the 20th century, with the powerful final words of the famous Hitler-opponent Dietrich Bonhoeffer, written shortly before the theologian's execution by the Nazis: \"This is the end — for me, the beginning of life.\"\n"," For Widmann, this confidence is not a reason to do nothing, but quite the opposite.\n","\"It may sound naïve, but I firmly believe that we can and must use music to help stop the disaster into which our world is sinking,\" Widmann explained. \"Bach saw it no differently in his time and would see it the same way today, I'm sure.\"\n","\n","The program features nearly five dozen concerts and other events over 11 festival days, June 8-18, at more than 20 venues across the city.\n","But if that is still not enough, Bach fans can also head to Leipzig's handsome marketplace. Under a bright summer sky, and with free admission, young and experienced Bach musicians from all over — from violin virtuoso Daniel Hope and star pianist Lang Lang to the heavy metal band \"Son of a Bach\" — will perform throughout the festival.\n","Lang Lang told the audience his appearance in Leipzig was a \"dream come true.\" He said he had never felt so close to the greatest genius of music as here, in Leipzig.\n","Lang Lang enchanted the audience with fragments of the famous Goldberg Variations, played with a depth and intimacy that could hardly be surpassed.\n","Bach is a composer who speaks directly to the heart, from the past to the present — and the future.  \n","DW is a media partner of the Bach Festival Leipzig.\n","This article was adapted from German.\n","'Lee Miller: From muse to war photographer 11.06.2023'\n","Born in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1907, Elizabeth \"Lee\" Miller showed an early interest in the arts and Europe, moving to Paris at age 18 to study lighting, costume and design at a theater school. A year later, she moved to New York City, studying theater, drawing and painting.\n","Soon after, she became one of the most sought-after models in New York, purely by accident, when Conde Montrose Nast, the publisher of Vogue magazine, saved her from getting run over by a car. But Miller quickly tired of modeling, and was far more interested in taking photographs herself.\n","In 1929, Miller returned to Paris, where she became the student, muse, lover and collaborator of the artist and photographer Man Ray. Together, they made the technique of solarization — used here in this portrait of Miller made by Ray — one of their aesthetic trademarks. Miller set up her own photographic studio and established herself as an artist.\n","After leaving Man Ray, Miller married her first husband, Egyptian businessman Aziz Eloui Bey, in 1934 and moved with him to Cairo. There, she applied her surrealism-trained eye to photographing the natural landscape of Egypt, resulting in some of her best-known artworks like this photo, \"Portrait of Space.\"\n","In 1937, Miller returned to Paris, where she met her second husband, the British surrealist painter Roland Penrose, with whom she later had a son. The couple settled in London, and with the outbreak of the Second World War, Miller decided to put her photographic skills to use as a war correspondent for Vogue magazine.\n","She traveled through England and Europe and was at the frontlines, the only woman photographer granted permission to travel independently in the war zones. The photos she took during this period merged photojournalism with art, as her surrealist sensibilities informed the framing of her shots.\n"," \n","Miller was also praised for picking out small moments that a man might have missed. One of her most famous photos shows her bathing in Hitler's bathtub in Munich on the same day the Nazi dictator committed suicide in Berlin. She was billeted in Hitler's Munich apartment after documenting the liberated Dachau concentration camp.\n","Miller was motivated by empathy more than a desire to aestheticize, and her photos of the death and destruction und human suffering she witnessed retain their shocking power more than seven decades later. \n","Lee Miller shared close friendships with several of her fellow artists, including Pablo Picasso. She took nearly 1,000 photos of him during the four decades they knew each other, and he painted her six times. Miller’s son, Antony Penrose, has written a children’s book about his childhood experiences with the artist, titled \"The Boy Who Bit Picasso.\" This photograph by Miller of the two was taken at Picasso’s studio in Paris shortly after the liberation of the city by Allied forces.\n","\n","Miller remained deeply affected by what she saw and documented during the war, and suffered from depression and alcoholism after returning to England. She eventually gave up photography, turning her creativity to cooking gourmet meals for her friends and family.\n","Lee Miller died of cancer at the age of 70 in 1977. Her trailblazing influence and legacy, both as an artist and a war reporter, have earned her an important place in the history of 20th-century photography. The Bucerius Kunst Forum in Hamburg is now dedicating a retrospective to this remarkable photographer. \n","Edited by: Manasi Gopalakrishnan\n","'Rammstein tour goes on despite accusations against Lindemann 07.06.2023'\n","Despite the accusations of sexual misconduct against singer Till Lindemann, Rammstein's European tour continues.\n","On Wednesday, Rammstein is set to perform the first of four concerts in Munich, while the allegations continue to swirl over the band's lead singer.\n","The public prosecutor's office has yet to officially investigate the band and its frontman.\n","\n","According to numerous statements reported in German media by those affected, Lindemann is said to have \"ordered\" young women from the audience to come backstage to have sex with him.\n","Some of the women say they were drugged. The selection of the young women was carried out by the self-proclaimed \"casting director\" Alena Makeeva, who \"invited\" the girls to the alleged pre- or after-show party, and who has since parted company with the band, Die Welt reported this week.\n","In addition, the band's management has hired a law firm to investigate the allegations. And it has announced an awareness concept for the four Munich concerts, a spokesman for Olympiapark München GmbH said.\n","Accordingly, six employees are to be on the lookout for unusual situations in the stadium in conjunction with security. In addition, there is to be a safe-space area where those affected can withdraw.\n","There are already consequences for the upcoming concerts. The so-called \"Row Zero,\" the security area directly in front of the stage, has been abandoned. For the past four years, small groups of mostly very young, often conspicuously dressed women, have been seen there on the right and left edges of the stage.\n","After-show parties have also been dispensed with and no selfies with Lindemann will be taking place.\n","Johnny Depp is set to be honored for his life's work at the San Sebastian International film Festival, despite allegations of domestic violence.

The association is in talks with the ministry \"to jointly advance this important process,\" a spokesperson said.\n","Till Lindemann himself remains silent and has deleted his Instagram profile.\n","The band Rammstein did release a collective statement on social media this week, asking not to be judged.\n","jsi/als (dpa)\n","\"Picasso's 'Buste de Femme' fetches €3.4 million in Germany 05.06.2023\"\n","In 1971, two years before his death, Pablo Picasso created the painting \"Buste de Femme.\" Art historians identified the woman in the painting as Picasso's second wife, Jacqueline Roque.\n","Now, that painting has garnered €3.4 million ($3.65 million): on Monday, it was sold at the the Cologne auction house Van Ham in Cologne.\n","The work was originally expected to fetch between €1.5 to 2.4 million ($1.6 to 2.6 million). But even at €3.4 million, it was still a bargain compared to the record-breaking $179.4 million dollars (some €160 million euros) paid for Picasso's \"The Women of Algiers\" in 2015. \n","The auction house launched a PR campaign to try to drive up the price of \"Buste de Femme,\" displaying the work in Berlin, Munich and Hamburg before the auction. According to Van Ham, it was the first time in nearly 25 years that a major work by Picasso went up for auction in Germany. \n","The painting of Roque was originally from her estate, but was auctioned on behalf of a German private collector.\n","Picasso and Roque met in 1953, and Roque, who was born in France in 1927, was more than 40 years younger than the Spanish-born artist. They married following the death of the painter's first wife, Olga Khokhlova.\n","\n","Picasso depicted Roque, with her thick dark hair and classically Mediterranean facial features, more often any of his numerous mistresses or his other wife.\n","None of her predecessors devoted their lives as fully to Picasso as Roque did. She moved back to France in 1954 and was at his side almost constantly until his death on April 8, 1973, which left her utterly bereft.\n","Emaciated and severely depressed, she took her own life 13 years later. Roque had worshipped Picasso and called him her \"sun.\" At the time of her suicide, Roque was 59 years old.\n"," \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","2023 marks the 50th anniversary of Pablo Picasso's death, and museums around the world are paying tribute with exhibitions. But the celebrations have also increasingly focused on the Spanish-born artist's relationships with his wives and mistresses.\n","Only now — in the wake of the #MeToo movement and a new wave of self-assertion among women — is new focus being paid to the ways in which Picasso exploited his power and influence with women. \n","The artist himself made no secret of that: he once said he divided women into goddesses and doormats, and almost all of the women in his life underwent this shift at some point. But now, on the occasion of the landmark year, new books and exhibitions are drawing attention to it as well.

In 1999, a collision between two trains in West Bengal killed 285 people, and in 2010, 145 died in the same state when a passenger train derailed and was hit by a cargo train. More recently, in 2016, 160 people died when a passenger train traveling between the cities of Indore and Patna slipped off its tracks.\n","For the last few years, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to stimulate its rail modernization push by introducing high-speed, automated trains in one of the largest and busiest rail networks in the world. This includes a plan to have 100% electrification of the railways by 2024 and make the network carbon-neutral by 2030.\n","Earlier this year, German engineering giant Siemens received a huge order to manufacture 1,200 electric trains, while Japanese expertise has been commissioned to provide technology and finance to assist in the construction of the first bullet train, a 508-kilometer (316-mile) link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad.\n","But experts have blamed crumbling infrastructure for causing numerous train accidents, raising questions about the money spent on train maintenance and track renewal.\n","Indian Railways, considered to be the lifeline of the nation with between 1.3 to 1.4 million employees, and carries around 23 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight every day. Over 21,000 trains work on a broad-gauge network of some 68,000 kilometers (42,000 miles).\n","However, according to an assessment by the government's comptroller and auditor general, 163 of the 217 \"consequential train accidents\" from 2017 to 2018 and 2020 to 2021 were caused by derailments, accounting for around 75% of accidents.\n","The report, submitted to parliament last December, said a major factor in these accidents was the lack of maintenance on railway tracks. Funds for track renewal had declined, the report said, and, in many cases, were not being fully utilized.\n","Fires, accidents at unmanned level crossings and collisions were the other causes of accidents cited by the report. What is more, concerns have been flagged on the acute shortage of manpower, especially in track safety, with many posts lying vacant in departments across the network.\n","Though the cause of the Odisha accident is still being investigated, officials have hinted that the likely reason was a signaling error that led the Chennai-bound Coromandel Express to fatally change tracks, causing it to ram into a stationary freight train.\n","\n","\"From the nature of the accident, it was caused by an error in the electronic signaling system that led a train to wrongly change tracks,\" a senior railway official, requesting anonymity, told DW. \"The passenger train entered another loop line and crashed into a goods train.\"\n","\"There was no anti-collision device on the train, as far as I know,\" Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal chief minister and a former railway minister, told the Indian media. \"Had the device been on the train, this would not have happened.\"\n","The new anti-train collision system, named Kavach, causes trains to brake automatically, but it has only been operational on 2% of the vast rail network.\n","The Kavach system is designed to help train operators avoid signal passing and overspeeding while also providing support for train operations during adverse weather conditions such as dense fog. By automatically applying brakes when necessary, the system ensures better control over train speed.\n","\"If the Modi government has effected a quantum increase in modernization and expansion of the rail network, with an unprecedented increase in capital expenditure, has investment in safety increased proportionately?\" said M K Venu, an economic analyst, speaking with DW.\n","The initial development of Kavach began in 2012 and was completed last year. But less than 5 billion Indian rupees (€56.5 million/$605 million) was allocated to install the system last year, when estimates suggested that a trillion rupees would have been necessary to cover the entire railway network. This year's budget has brought a windfall for railways, with $29 billion allocated for railway development, the highest ever.\n","Apparently realizing that the railways have a huge multiplier effect on the economy, the government is now planning to double lines more quickly, convert nearly the entire network to broad-gauge, introduce high-powered locomotives and complete electrification projects. All of these measures are expected to increase Indian Railways' line capacity.\n","India has also rolled out the high-speed, automated Vande Bharat trains, equipped with state-of-the-art passenger amenities that provide a faster and more convenient travel experience.\n","The government intends to introduce nearly 400 Vande Bharat trains during the next five years and manufacture hydrogen-powered, eco-friendly Vande Metro trains to replace old trains designed in the 1950s and '60s.\n","A lot more still needs to be done to upgrade the 65,000 kilometers (more than 40,300 miles) of tracks and install modern signaling equipment on the network. For now, the train accident in eastern Odisha is a stark reminder of the obstacles facing the government in delivering on its promise to make the railways more efficient, and safer.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Edited by: Ben Knight\n","Correction, June 4, 2023: This article was updated to correct the length of India's railway network and number of employees.\n","'Venice Architecture Biennale focuses on Africa 04.06.2023'\n","The 18th edition of the architecture exhibition in Venice, which runs until November 26, 2023 is designed as a workshop of ideas under the theme \"Laboratory of the Future.\" This year's Biennale, at which architects from all over the world will congregate, presents 63 national pavilions in the old brick halls of the Arsenale, the former shipyard and naval base of the former Republic of Venice. \n","This year's installment is dominated by climate change issues and a reappraisal of the colonial era. It's about questions of production, resources and representation, said chief curator Lesley Naa Norle Lokko at a press conference ahead of the event: \"It's about change.\"\n","And change is much needed. According to UN predictions, the world's population will grow from its current 8 billion to 10 billion by 2050. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, the population could double. That's incredible, said Peter Cachola Schmal, architecture expert and director of the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt. The fact is that these people will need — and want — a roof over their heads.\n","For this reason, Lokko has deliberately focused on the African continent. The Ghanaian-Scottish architect, university lecturer and bestselling novelist curated the show's central exhibition — and invited 55 offices from around the world, with many from Africa or having African roots.\n","The consequences of global warming, resource consumption and migration are especially visible on the continent, and it's where Lokko sees the greatest challenges for architecture. Africa is the continent with the world's youngest population and the fastest urbanization — with 4% annual growth that often happens at the expense of local ecosystems. All of this puts Africa at the forefront of climate change, said Lokko.\n","There is no doubt that Africa has a huge need for construction. The question is how to build in times of climate change: the construction and operation of buildings accounts for about 40% of climate-damaging emissions, according to the WWF. Cement production alone accounts for about 8% of greenhouse gases worldwide.\n","That poses a dilemma. \"What does it mean for the world's CO2 management if unimaginable quantities of cement are produced in Africa all at once?\" asked architecture expert Schmal in a DW interview. \"The future contradicts all our goals of saving the world from climate collapse.\" \n","There is also the very practical question: Who is going to build the 1 billion housing units needed to accommodate all the people flocking to the growing megacities? Who, if not China?\n","For years, China's strategy has been to build African infrastructure, said Schmal, adding that the \"Chinese can do it.\" In China, they have shown they can produce infrastructure — housing, construction, transportation — for tens of millions of people within a few years, he said. \"They have the experience that we don't have,\" he argued. \"The West slept through that.\"\n","Whether the Venice Architecture Biennale is a wake-up call remains to be seen. The show certainly presents as a showcase of ideas, curated for the first time by a woman who grew up in Africa and who likely has different perspective on global architecture.\n","Lokko, born in 1964, is widely traveled. She grew up in Accra, the capital of  Ghana, and moved to the United Kingdom to study Hebrew and Arabic at Oxford University. She then studied architecture in London, where she earned her doctorate. Over her decadeslong career, she has taught on four continents.\n","Lokko is also a bestselling author, having published novels over the past 20 years that set a political and moral bar for contemporary events, from \"Sundowners\" in 2003 to \"Soul Sisters\" in 2021. Many of her books explore the lives of Black women in all corners of the world.\n","The architect has two buzzwords for her colleagues concerning the debate about the future — decarbonization and decolonization, lowering CO2 emissions and overcoming the legacy of colonization respectively. Both are likely to be discussed at the Venice architecture show. As was the case at last year's documenta 15, the world's largest art exhibition based in the German city of Kassel, the voice of the Global South will also be heard loud and clear in Venice.\n","The future of the planet will be decided in Africa, said Peter Cachola Schmal. Living conditions for people in sub-Saharan Africa must be \"adequate,\" he warned, adding it would be wise to help support the effort. Otherwise, more refugees could be headed to Europe. \"The West must prepare,\" he said.\n","Sustainability is the focus of the German pavilion at the Biennale, under the motto \"Open for Maintenance — Open due to Reconstruction,\" jointly curated by Summacumfemmer, ARCH+ and Büro Juliane Greb. They took over the pavilion as designed by Berlin-based artist, Maria Eichhorn, for last year's International Art Exhibition.

Do you think this is still worth mentioning or has Germany overcome the stereotypes that might have prevented such an appointment in the past?\n","The truth is that I am the only African who is the director of such an institution in Germany. That means it's not completely normal yet. Things can still be improved. We have to keep working on that and in a few years, I hope it won't be a rarity anymore.\n","Do you think that as an African, as a Cameroonian, your programming you have planned for the Haus der Kulturen der Welt is different from that which would be planned by a German director?\n","Of course. Because knowledge is embodied.\n","As a Cameroonian, as someone who grew up in Bamenda, as an African, I carry with me different knowledge, different philosophies, I speak different languages.\n","I think that the program we are going to propose will indeed be different.\n","And above all, it's not just about me, because I managed to form a team of almost 15 exhibition curators who come from different parts of the world, who will also bring different knowledge. They come from Asia, South America, Africa, the United States and Europe. And that, of course, will influence our program.\n","You are a specialist in biotechnology by training, but you nevertheless began to take an interest in art and culture at an early age. Did you first avoid becoming an art historian for financial reasons?\n","I've had an interest in art since my childhood. But when I came to Germany, it was clear that I couldn't study art history — because in my context, in Cameroon, it's not something that gives you work afterwards.\n","So how did you get into the arts?\n","Already in Cameroon, I was very close to the artists. This means that I started my art studies when I was maybe 17 or 18, when I went to Yaoundé to study. But afterwards, in Berlin, after my studies, we had the opportunity to meet artists and it started like that.\n","My father was an anthropologist and therefore, when I was little, there were quite a few books by writers like Aimé Césaire, Walter Rodney or Jomo Kenyatta, as well as many other publications, and especially the works of Léopold Sédar Senghor. So I have learned the post-colonial critical discourse already from my childhood.\n","You are sometimes described as an intransigent militant against colonialism. Does this have to do with the fact that your father was an anthropologist?\n","I wouldn't call myself a militant for any cause — because I don't like the word \"militant.\" I rather see myself as an advocate for the things that I find important in society.\n","What is your position regarding the return of looted works to Africa?\n","It is very clear that I would like to see the objects that were taken from Africans, Asians, Native Americans, or other parts of the world, returned to their original context. I would love to see a world where people are reunited with their sacred objects and their history.\n","What does this mean exactly?\n","It means that colonial history has really created destruction, all over the world. And that people have lost their history. \"Restitution\" means to return, but it also means to heal what has been destroyed. I think you can't do decolonization without healing, without restitution and without reparation and without rehabilitation. That's why I'm getting involved!\n","I repeat, I'm not a militant. But I'm passionate about it because we have to take our history into our own hands. To move forward in this world that is so destabilized, where there are a lot of imbalances, we have to restore harmony. And my project is a humanistic project to find harmony in the world.\n","Does the healing process also involve apologies?\n","Apologies are a starting point, but not the end.\n","When you give an apology, you look at the wounds you have made. It is an acknowledgment of what has been done. You can admit that you hurt people, that you recognize it and apologize. But that's not enough because the injury is still there.\n","What can we do to heal these wounds?\n","We need to engage in this process of healing, which really means restoring what has been destroyed. And in fact, restitution — I really want to emphasize this — is not only about returning works, but is also about the restitution of knowledge and the restitution of the dignity of human beings.\n","One of the greatest evils that has been inflicted in the context of colonization is the dehumanization of human beings. And we have to do exercises of re-humanization, of re-establishing this humanity that we have destroyed.\n","How can we restore this dignity in a very concrete way?\n","Very concretely, there are several paths that can be taken. We need to accept that there is no gradient between human beings, and that all human beings have the right to be what they want to be.\n","This interview was originally conducted in French.\n","\n","'How supermodel Heidi Klum built a multimillion-euro empire 01.06.2023'\n","Working both in her native Germany and in the United States, Heidi Klum is one of the world's most successful celebrities.

She also has a producer credit on the show.\n","Klum was one of the original judges since the inception of the show, with \"Auf Wiedersehen\" serving as her famous catchphrase to bid farewell to the losing contestants. Similar to her GNTM persona, she is direct with her criticism and earnest, yet exudes warmth and encouragement.\n","Up until 2017, Harvey Weinstein was an executive producer for the show, and Klum opened up about how he lost that credit since the sexual harassment and assault accusations surfaced. \"I truly admire these brave women who are coming forward to share their stories because change cannot come unless there is a dialogue and people are held accountable,\" Klum told People magazine.\n","Klum has also regularly participated in determining the fate of contestants on various \"America's Got Talent\" shows. including \"America's Got Talent: All-Stars\" in 2023.

What? Do we have an expiration date? Can we not also still feel sexy? I feel sexy.\"\n","According to her legion of international fans, she definitely still is.\n","This article was updated from a previous profile for Heidi Klum's 50th birthday on June 1, 2023.\n","'German left-wing extremist Lina E. found guilty 31.05.2023'\n","A 28-year-old German student was found guilty of founding a criminal organization and committing six serious attacks on neo-Nazis, in an unusual case of violent left-wing extremism in Germany.\n","She was sentenced to five years and three months in prison but was later told she would only have to return to jail if she also loses an appeal. Her three male co-defendants were sentenced to around three years in prison each.\n","The defendants were greeted on Wednesday with a huge round of applause, many of them waving and smiling to friends and relatives in the courtroom in Dresden. When Lina E. herself was brought in, the applause was even louder and longer, with virtually the whole of the gallery, apart from the journalists, standing up.\n","As soon as the sentence was read, the gallery began chanting leftist messages of support. The judge called for quiet so he could read out his reasoning, saying: \"Anyone who is interested in hearing why the verdict was the way it was, can stay.\" Someone immediately shouted: \"Because you're fascist friends!\" Others called out: \"F***ing class justice!\"\n","The judge immediately called a 15-minute break, during which people who had shouted were to be removed by security.\n","\n","There were loud groans of protest and tuts of disgust from the gallery throughout the reading of the court's reasoning. The judge said that, even if the political motivations of the defendants, such as fighting right-wing extremism, could be regarded as justified, that did not reduce the severity of their crimes. He also criticized the defense lawyers for describing the trial as \"political justice.\"\n","The judge also took time to defend the German justice system, mentioning the number of convictions against violent far-right extremists that this court had itself handed down in the past few years. Again, this was greeted with scoffing and sarcastic laughter from the gallery.\n","However, late on Wednesday evening as the proceedings were drawing to a close, the judge gave the defendants' supporters in the courtroom a reason to cheer instead. \n","After spending an exhausting day reading the court's entire reasoning (which took upwards of eight hours, including breaks), presiding judge Hans Schlüter-Staats did have one more surprise: By now audibly hoarse after recounting the details of the police investigation in painstaking detail, the judge declared in the evening that Lina E. would be freed until the conviction was upheld. \n","Provided she gives up her passport and ID and reports to the police twice a week, Lina E. will be allowed to return home until any appeals are exhausted. If she does return to prison, she will have only around three years of her five-year sentence to serve, since she has been in custody since her arrest.\n","  \n","State prosecutors said Lina E.* and her three co-defendants — Lennart A., Philipp M., and Jannis R. — carried out a series of attacks on neo-Nazis in the eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony between 2018 and 2020, including two attacks on Leon R., a notorious far-right extremist who was himself arrested for allegedly forming a far-right extremist organization.\n","The group around Lina E. is believed to have raided a well-known neo-Nazi bar in the town of Eisenach in late 2019 and attacked Leon R. with hammers and batons. When the initial attack failed, the group attacked him again a few weeks later outside his car. Other neo-Nazis were left with broken bones and other injuries after the attacks.\n","Much of the prosecution's case rested on the testimony of a member of her group who turned state's witness: thirty-year-old Johannes D., who said before the Dresden Higher Regional Court that the four defendants had trained specifically for attacks on right-wing extremists. But later allegedly said that it was merely a matter of normal martial arts training for physical exercise. \n","The level of planning was key to the prosecution's case, as the accusation that Lina E. was the leader of a criminal organization rested on arguments that the attacks were specially trained for. \n","The case has created plenty of political tension, with the defense and far-left scenes in Lina E.'s home city of Leipzig saying that she has been scapegoated as a left-wing terrorist by both the media and the authorities. Many allege that the justice system is too lenient on neo-Nazi perpetrators.\n","\"Free Lina\" signs and collection boxes for her defense fund have been put out in the Leipzig district of Connewitz, a left-wing hub where Lina E. herself lived. \n","But Hendrik Hansen, a specialist in extremism and professor at the Federal University of Applied Administrative Sciences, argues that the media has, if anything, underestimated the dangers of left-wing extremism.\n","\"This trial is a clear success,\" Hansen told DW. \"In the area around Leipzig we are facing the rise of clandestine structures that are very well networked in the left-wing extremist scene, and who are using methods that they have not used before.\"\n","Hansen said Lina E.'s group could clearly be classified as a criminal organization, and could well be described as terrorist: \"This was a whole group of people planning attacks so minutely that they were using the appropriate technology, like disposable mobile phones. They had scouts, who spied on the victims. The tasks within the group were very precisely divided up.\"\n","Hansen said that the evidence showed that the group was not merely planning street-fighting methods, but targeted assaults aimed at seriously injuring or even killing their victims. \"Terrorism is defined as using politically motivated violence to spread fear and horror either within the general population or within a certain group of people,\" he said.\n","Lina E. was born in Kassel, central Germany, she showed interest in a career as a social worker working with disadvantaged youth, and during her studies wrote about how to deal with far-right radicalization among young people.\n","Kassel is located in the state of Hesse, which has a large far-right scene, and in 2006 the city was the scene of one of the 10 murders carried out by the right-wing terrorist group the National Socialist Underground (NSU). Lina E. is reported to have become politicized by the uncovering of the NSU in 2011, which caused major controversy and investigations across Germany about law enforcement and intelligence failures.\n","She has now spent the last two and a half years since her arrest in the same prison in Chemnitz where the only known surviving NSU member, Beate Zschäpe, is also imprisoned. \n","Edited by: Rina Goldenberg\n","This article was first published ahead of the verdict and later updated to reflect news developments.\n","*Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which stresses the importance of protecting the privacy of suspected criminals or victims and urges us to refrain from revealing the full names of alleged criminals.

So far, 100,000 Stolpersteine have been installed in 27 European countries.\n","The latest Stolperstein, installed on May 26, honors Johann Wild, a firefighter from Nuremberg. He was executed for writing letters in which he denounced the Nazi regime.\n","Demnig launched his project in Cologne in 1996, illegally, without official permission.\n","The first plaque was placed on the anniversary of the so-called Auschwitz Decree issued by Heinrich Himmler, one of the main people responsible for the Holocaust.\n","With the decree, the former Reichsführer SS ordered the deportation of all Sinti and Roma living in the German Reich. Demnig's Stolpersteine are a private form of remembrance, separate from the state culture of remembrance in Germany.  \n","\"The Stolpersteine are my life's work,\" says the 75-year-old sculptor. He lives with his wife Katja in central Hesse, western Germany. His trademark is a wide-brimmed brown cowboy hat. In the beginning, he laid the 10-by-10-centimeter (4-by-4 inch) cubes himself, but now other people are getting involved. The names and fates of the victims are engraved on the brass plaques.\n","The artist remembers many of the stories behind the plaques. \"At one laying ceremony, two sisters came,\" he says. \"One came from Colombia, the other from Scotland. Both had been saved by the Kindertransport [an organized rescue effort for children from Nazi-controlled territory], but their parents were murdered. They hadn't seen each other in 60 years and said, 'Now we're reunited with our parents.'\" Demnig says, covering his eyes with his hand and fighting back tears. Such encounters have made him realize the meaning of his initiative, he adds.\n","These days, the new Stolpersteine are initiated by historical societies, citizens' initiatives, or school projects. A plaque costs €132 ($142), inclusing having it laid.\n","The idea behind the Stolpersteine is that people walking along will see the bronze plaque and stop, curious to know whom it commemorates and what happened to them. That's the effect Demnig hopes to achieve. The artist is convinced that \"there's a difference between a teenager opening a book and reading about 6 million murdered Jews, and them learning about the fate of a family while standing where they lived.\"\n","But some people, including representatives of Jewish organizations, are critical of the project. Charlotte Knobloch, a leader of the Jewish community in Munich, says that by putting the plaques in the pavement, Demnig is allowing the victims' fates to literally be stepped all over.\n","The artist rejects that criticism out of hand, calling it an \"unspeakable counterargument.\" He says that statements of that kind trivialize Nazi atrocities and mock the victims: \"The Nazis weren't content to simply trample their victims. They had a targeted extermination program,\" says Demnig.\n","The originator of the Stolpersteine won't let the objections to his project — which even go as far as death threats — deter him from continuing his mission.\n","Gunter Demnig says he wants to call attention to Nazi crimes, wherever they were committed. And he wants to give the victims of the Holocaust back their names and their dignity, and make sure they will not be forgotten.\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'Why a German museum is putting two Nazi sculptures on show 29.05.2023'\n","Nazi artist Josef Thorak created the two \"Striding Horses\" (known in German as \"Schreitende Pferde\") for Adolf Hitler's New Reich Chancellery in Berlin.\n","Now the sculptures will be shown again for the first time in the Spandau Citadel. One of the horses has been on display there for some time, and the second one is now being unveiled and examined by restorers.\n","On the Day of the Open Monument on September 10, 2023, it will be permanently presented again for the first time, according to the museum, along with other problematic works of art.\n","Commissioned by Hitler at the height of his power, the colossal twin \"Striding Horses\" had stood in the garden of Hitler's seat of government from 1939 to 1943. They were part of the thousands of bronze works crafted for the Nazi regime in its quest to transform Berlin into the imperial global capital of \"Germania.\"\n","Josef Thorak was born in Vienna on February 7, 1889 and attended the Vienna Art Academy, eventually moving on to the Berlin Art Academy in 1915. After his studies he established himself as a sculptor of monumental works such as the 4-meter-high (13-foot) gable figure for the Reichsbank building in the western German city of Buer.\n","His style secured him numerous government commissions, and he became known internationally when he worked on, among others, the Security Monument in Ankara, Turkey, in 1934.\n","From 1937 onward, Thorak became one of the preferred sculptors of the Nazis, commissioned to create countless propaganda sculptures emphasizing the supposed strength and glory of the regime.\n","While Hitler and his regime persecuted Jewish and modern artists who they claimed produced \"degenerate art\" and looted the collections of Jewish art collectors, Thorak flourished. He divorced his Jewish wife and accepted a prestigious position at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. After the end of World War II, he continued to create unchallenged until his death in 1952.\n","The \"Striding Horses\" were only rediscovered in 2015 after a spectacular raid on an underground art trading ring operating in Germany. Police secured the horse statues, as well as sculptures by Fritz Klimsch and Arno Breker, two more of Hitler's favorite artists.\n","The works were probably intended to be sold on the black market, because Nazi art remains taboo on the official market, as art historian Christian Fuhrmeister told DW in 2015. \"There are some private collectors in Germany, in the US or in Russia, there are people who are enthusiastic about it,\" he said.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","According to the official website of the Spandau Citadel, a former Renaissance fortress turned exhibition space, the purpose of displaying the sculptures is to illuminate how \"the respective state powers wanted to shape the Berlin cityscape\" through the monuments they commissioned. The collection features monuments created from 1849 to 1986, covering the German Reich, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany and East Germany.\n","Stating on its website that the sculptures are \"testimonies to German history,\" the museum has deemed the featured monuments \"important symbols\" of German history. The adjective \"important\" may raise some eyebrows, but the museum explains it is aiming to transform itself into a center for the study of \"toxic\" monuments. The federal government has also supported the acquisition of the \"Striding Horses.\" \n"," \n","Previously, the display of Nazi art has led to fierce protest. Last year, the Pinakothek in Munich was slammed in an open letter for displaying a painting by Adolf Ziegler, another Nazi artist. Georg Baselitz, one of the world's most influential living artists, called for it to be removed. \n","\"It is shocking that Nazi propaganda is possible in this grubby way in a Munich museum,\" Baselitz wrote last October. He added that it was \"unbearable\" that works by artists who were persecuted by the Nazis hung next to the work of an artist responsible for their persecution.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","In fact, plenty of Nazi propaganda sculptures remain in public spaces, such as in Berlin's Olympic Stadium, commissioned by the Nazi regime for the 1936 Olympics. Ahead of the World Cup in 2006, for which the stadium was one of the venues, some activists called for the removal of its statues. However, the city refused on the grounds that a removal would be a denial of Germany's history.\n","Edited by: Brenda Haas\n","'Reclaiming the history of Ukrainian art 28.05.2023'\n","On a Monday afternoon in Cologne, Ukrainian curator Yuliia Berdiiaro­va meets me at the rear entrance of Museum Ludwig. The museum, next to the main train station and Cologne cathedral, is closed to the public on Mondays.\n","Berdiiarova, a 29-year-old art historian, worked at the Odesa Fine Arts Museum and the Mystetskyi Arsenal in Kyiv before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n","In her role at Museum Ludwig, she has organized a school vacation program for Ukrainian refugee children and their parents. She also conducts research into Ukrainian modernism, which had previously been falsely attributed to the Russian avant-garde.\n","Berdiiarova offers to show me some of the artworks that will be displayed from June 3 as part of the exhibition, \"Modernism in Ukraine 1900-1930s.\" The curator has been part of the Museum Ludwig team for almost a year, and she's helping to prepare this show.\n","Many of the works in this extensive exhibition, previously on show in Madrid, were removed from Ukraine due to the war, and had never before been displayed outside the country. The exhibition is completed by works that have been taken out of Museum Ludwig's storage.\n","We take the stairs to the first floor and walk through the museum, which is mostly empty. Berdiiarova says museums without people make her sad. \"A lot of museums (in Ukraine) are still closed,\" she says. \"It's a place for dialogue sometimes. It's a place for relief, to feel connection with history, to feel connection with other people.\"\n","Even in Cologne, Russia's war in Ukraine is ever-present for Berdiiarova. But she knows she's one of the lucky ones. Her position at Museum Ludwig and her stay in Cologne are financed by three different foundations. But last June, when she left Odesa, where she'd worked as a museum curator for six years, she didn't know what was next. She took a step into the unknown.\n","\"It was a very hard decision to leave Odesa,\" she says. \"I don't want to call it an adventure because adventure is something good, but it was not an adventure in a good way. It was just like a step into nothing. I had a really small bag. That was all.\"\n","That bag contained nothing more than her documents, ID and the most essential clothes. Berdiiarova has since had some of her clothes sent to her from Ukraine, and before me stands a stylish woman all in black: A turtleneck top, a suit, sunglasses. She says, with a wink, that she tries to look the part of a typical museum curator, inspired by the famous Kasimir Malevich painting, \"Black Square.\"\n","Berdiiarova would have preferred to stay in Ukraine. She says that in the first few months of the war, she and her colleagues initially took works from the museum in Odesa to safety, but then life there became impossible.\n","She fled across to Warsaw, from where she continued first to Berlin, then to Cologne. Ukrainian colleagues sent her information about a program for Ukrainian curators in Germany from the Ernst Siemens Foundation.\n","She hasn't abandoned her homeland in Cologne; on the contrary, she says she's fighting in her own way: with words. At Museum Ludwig, she's corrected all the names of Ukrainian artists. \"First, we freed the spelling of the cities from their Russian spelling. That was part of the Soviet Union's culture of appropriation, to Russify names of cities and people. We made Kharkov into Kharkiv again. The names were transliterated from the Russian alphabet into the Latin alphabet. And I'm very proud that Museum Ludwig agreed to the corrections.\"\n","So, the Ukrainian artist Alexander Bogomazov is now Oleksandr Bohomazov and the Ukrainian capital is now spelled \"Kyiv.\"\n","The war has now helped familiarize the public with Ukraine and its art history – thanks in part to Berdiiarova's work. She combed through the Museum Ludwig's collection and not only came across names of Ukrainian artists whose names still had the Russian spellings, she also corrected national affiliations.\n","Kazimir Malevich, for instance, \"had a Ukrainian passport during the Soviet era, where it was written that he was Ukrainian.\" Berdiiarova adds that he spent a significant portion of his career as a professor at the Kyiv Academy of Arts, and published texts in Ukrainian magazines. She says that Malevich's Ukrainian identity was suppressed, so he was always considered a representative of the Russian avant-garde.\n","Other Ukrainian artists, like Vasyl Yermilov, were also co-opted by the Russian avant-garde. The artist was born in Kharkiv in 1894 but was considered a representative of the Russian Constructivist movement. Now, on the initiative of Yuliia Berdiiarova, his works hang in a new context – alongside works by Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich. \"Late, but justice all the same,\" Berdiiarova says proudly. \n","\"We are trying to understand how the concept of the Russian avant-garde was part of the system of appropriation of culture in the post-imperialist area, and why it has so much power,\" she said. \"Why was the imperialist background of the Soviet Union overlooked for so long in the first place? These are all very long processes.\"\n","So, along with numerous colleagues, she is compiling a list of all the Ukrainian artists in collections worldwide. The list is intended to prove how diverse the Ukrainian art landscape has been, and how Russian propaganda denied it a place in art history.\n","Even though she feels at home in Cologne – and the modern \"Crane Houses\" along the Rhine remind her of motifs from constructivist paintings, as she recounts with a smile – she also feels very lonely. So she wants to return to Odesa when her program ends, even though the war will probably not be over by then. \"Odesa is my home. It's just too hard to be so far away. Sometimes it feels safer to be with your people, even when bombs are falling.\"\n","'Museums struggle to embrace diversity in new documentary 27.05.2023'\n","In December 2019, Rein Wolfs took over as director of the renowned Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and quickly set about making its collection and staff more diverse and inclusive.\n","Along for the ride was filmmaker Sarah Vos, who for three years captured this pioneering effort by a major cultural institution to effect greater diversity in its halls.    \n","Her camera observed as Wolfs, formerly the director of the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn in Germany, worked with museum staff to evaluate the range of the collection and the exhibition concepts.\n","The sobering conclusion was that less than 10% of works in the collection are by women. Works by artists who were Black, Indigenous or People of Color (BIPOC) were rarely seen.\n","The resulting documentary, \"White Balls on Walls,\" not only questions the level of diversity in the museum, but goes deeper to understand the function of art in society.\n","In the past, cultural institutions had \"not thought enough outside the box,\" Wolfs told DW.\n","By contrast, Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum  now wants to think more globally, and, for instance, align its diversity concept with the population structure of Amsterdam.\n","\"After all, we want everyone to have the opportunity to also find their own history and their own moments of identification,\" he said. \n","The discussion about a new concept raises questions: Can and should diversity be quantified through words or quotas? Should the origin and gender of artists play a role in the evaluation of art? \n","The Stedelijk team agreed on a quota: From 2021 to 2024, at least 50% of the acquisition budget should be spent on works by BIPOC artists. There are no fixed quotas for works by women, but gender is a factor in the selection process.\n","Moreover, there is at least one large annual exhibition of BIPOC artists or a group exhibition that addresses diversity, Wolf said.\n","Diversity plays an inherent role in ethnological museums featuring artifacts and art from all over the world, including at Frankfurt's Museum of World Cultures. \n","The museum focuses on the art of Indigenous people who are themselves minorities in their home countries, museum director Eva Raabe said. Works by women, children and queer people are a further focus of the collection and exhibits.  \n","Raabe said it wasn't not about specific quotas, but rather about the statement artists want to make with their works.\n","\"Through their art, which is an expression of their opinions, their needs, their lives, they tell us about the reality of their lives,\" she said.\n","By including a wide variety of perspectives, the selection is inherently diverse, she adds. \n","Meanwhile, Berliin's KINDL — Centre for Contemporary Art strives for a \"highly diversified exhibition program,\" director Kathrin Becker told DW. \n","\"I also have a personal mission here, which I share with many colleagues in Berlin and elsewhere, and that is to achieve a multitude of voices in the presentation of contemporary art,\" Becker said. \n","Gender identity, as well as ethnic and socioeconomic background, are important in this regard, she added.\n","\n","So how are artists responding to the debate about diversity in art and museums? Whom do quotas actually help?\n","\"I would find it almost insulting if the Stedelijk were to do an exhibition of my work just because they are looking for BIPOC artists,\"Surinamese-Dutch artist Remy Jungerman says in \"White Balls on Walls.\"\n","Wolfs, however, said he was not aware of artists not wanting to exhibit their work at the Stedelijk because of the quotas. \n","But the museum director is not surprised by criticism of Stedelijk's strategy for more inclusivity, and has heard accusations that the museum is putting its political agenda before art.\n","\"We're seen as ‘woke,' and that's a dirty word these days. We get a lot of praise, but we also get a lot of criticism,\" he said. \"But that's kind of a part of this institution; we're a museum that's always very much on the front lines.\"\n","The museum director sees a shift toward more diversity almost everywhere, not only in museums but in cultural policy and in social movements.\n","Kathrin Becker of Berlin's KINDL — Centre for Contemporary Art said museum directors were increasingly trying to counter \"very Western and Eurocentric\" collections with \"new ideas,\" including by \"inviting artists who don't represent Western art.\" \n","So how can museums become more diverse?\n","Whether diversity in the museum is ensured with quotas, is achieved through dialogue with artists or is created in multiperspective exhibitions, awareness of the issue appears to be driving change.\n","As Eva Raabe of Frankfurt's Museum of World Cultures surmises: \"You can actually always do more to give smaller groups a voice.\"\n","'US charges 2 over Chinese plot against Falun Gong movement 27.05.2023'\n","Two Los Angeles residents have been charged in connection with an alleged Chinese plot against the anti-communist spiritual movement, the US Justice Department on Friday.\n","US authorities accuse the duo of bribing an undercover agent posing as a US tax agent on behalf of Beijing to target the New York-based organization.\n","The two were arrested on Friday and charged with acting as unregistered agents of a foreign government, bribing a public official and conspiring to commit international money laundering. \n","One of them is a 70-year-old US citizen and the other is a 43-year-old permanent US resident.\n","A complaint against the two was filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, the Justice Department said.\n","According to the indictment, the suspects conspired to bribe an employee of the US tax agency IRS to get him to investigate the Falun Gong organization and revoke its tax-exempt status.\n","Prosecutors said the undercover officer, who was posing as the tax agent, recorded multiple conversations with one of the suspects, during which they discussed instructions allegedly received from Chinese government officials.\n","The suspect referred to these officials as \"blood brothers\" and expressed Beijing's willingness to reward the undercover officer for helping crack down on Falun Gong's non-profit status.\n","\"The Chinese government has yet again attempted, and failed, to target critics of the [People's Republic of China] here in the United States,\" Attorney General Merrick B.

Henry Kissinger turns 100 26.05.2023'\n","After a visit to the Palace of Versailles outside of Paris in the 1970s, journalists asked Henry Kissinger what it was like in the majestic Hall of Mirrors, to which he responded it was \"wonderful\" as he was \"surrounded by genius.\"\n","For supporters, Henry Kissinger is indeed a diplomatic genius who continues to master the art of discerning the politically achievable like no other. For critics, he is a  war criminal. For most, he and his political legacy fall somewhere in between.\n","During Kissinger's time first as a foreign policy adviser and later as secretary of state to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, he contributed to ending the Vietnam War, entering a détente with the Soviet Union, opening US relations with China, overthrowing a democratically elected leader and redrawing the borders of several countries. After leaving office, he went on to offer \"geopolitical consulting\" to scores of undisclosed international leaders with his Kissinger Associates consulting firm.\n","Even 100 years after he was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger to a Jewish family in the Bavarian city of Fürth, Kissinger is seen as an international foreign policy heavyweight and contributes his views on geopolitical issues.\n","He has often warned of the dangers artificial intelligence pose for the world. Putting AI into the same league as the danger from nuclear weapons, he warns his younger peers that this is a \"totally new problem.\" Quite a warning by a man who has seen it all.\n","On Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kissinger created a furor by calling for a negotiated peace in November. His appeal came at a point when Ukraine's Western allies had only just started substantively ramping up their military assistance to Kyiv. \n","While Kissinger argued imminent talks were necessary to avoid another devastating world war, Kyiv accused him of \"appeasing the aggressor.\"\n","Ken Lieberthal, who worked with Kissinger on several occasions over the past decades, said the centenarian has \"a clear view of what needs to be done\" and \"how to get from here to there.\" Kissinger's approach requires \"an unsentimental assessment of capabilities,\" Lieberthal explained. A devoted proponent of Realpolitik, Kissinger himself described his thinking about conflict in an even more straightforward manner: \"the ends justify the means.\"\n","Ukraine's criticism leaves Kissinger unfazed. When it comes to dealing with Russia, Kissinger, who masterminded America's détente policy in the 70s, can point to having been at the edge of war with Russia himself. Later he described detente as \"a strategy for conducting the conflict with the Soviet Union\" that bought both sides time for diplomacy and avoiding a hot conflict.\n","In a rare change of mind, he now backs Ukraine's future membership in NATO after he concluded that \"the idea of a neutral Ukraine in these conditions\" was \"no longer meaningful.\"\n","But his willingness to see principles of international law and human rights not as paramount, but simply one factor in his policy equations has human rights advocates around the world on edge as soon as they hear his name. US Senator Bernie Sanders, a leader of America's political Left, said he was \"proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend\" calling him the \"most destructive secretary of state in modern history\" over his policies in Asia in the 1970s.\n","Kissinger has described his often controversial take on strategic leadership as \"traversing a tightrope\" that is \"suspended between the relative certainties of the past and the ambiguities of the future.\"\n","Kissinger has written extensively on his decision-making process. It saw him initially hide the bombing of Cambodia from the US public. The US aimed to defeat the Viet Cong there but ended up enabling the murderous rise of the Khmer Rouge, which is estimated to have killed more than 2 million people. He had aimed to secure a cease-fire that would end the Vietnam War.  Both, he and his North Vietnamese counterpart, Le Duc Tho, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their plan. Only Kissinger accepted the award, and he tried to return the Prize when the attempt at a negotiated peace spectacularly failed with the fall of Saigon. Decisions he took along the way cost tens of thousands of lives in Vietnam, Cambodia and neighboring Laos. \n","Whenever Kissinger speaks publicly, which he still does to this day, there is no doubt that he is aware and unafraid of the grave consequences action entails. National Archive documents from the 70s, released 40 years later, proved that he pressed Nixon into overthrowing the democratically elected President Salvador Allende in 1973 because he felt Chile's \"model effect can be insidious\" for US interest in the region. By doing so, Kissinger effectively enabled the rise of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet whose government killed and tortured thousands of people. \n","\"He always thought in terms of a kind of balance of power,\" Lieberthal said of Kissinger's support for interventions in what should have been democratic processes.\n","According to Lieberthal, Kissinger was driven by the calculation that \"dominance by one country would produce efforts by others.\" Avoiding the instability such a chain reaction could produce led Kissinger to broker Nixon's historic recognition of China in 1972, a policy that continues to bind the US to a commitment that \"Taiwan is part of China.\" \n","The tensions currently playing out in the Taiwan Strait and the fear of a war over Taiwan mark the extension of  Kissinger's US foreign policy leadership from the 70s into the present day. Kissinger can claim to have recognized the trajectory of China toward a global power and systemic rival decades ahead of most of his peers.\n","While Kissinger celebrates his 100th birthday on Saturday (27.5.2023), politicians and scholars around the world will continue to debate the importance and impact of the policies passionately advocated by an American legend whose accented English continues to reveal his German roots.\n","Edited by: Sean Sinico\n","\"Tina Turner: Remembering the 'Queen of Rock 'n' Roll' 24.05.2023\"\n","A bundle of energy donning high heels, a miniskirt and a lion-like mane of hair: That's how fans knew rock queen Tina Turner. She also had that deep, smoky voice with which she wrote music history, and which secured her a spot as one of the greatest musicians of all time.\n","Celebrating her final world tour in 2009, Tina Turner gave her last concert on May 5, in Sheffield, England, naturally in front of a sold-out audience. Then, at the age of 69, her career in the limelight was finally over. \"It was a great show, really wonderful,\" she said years later in a rare interview with the BBC.\n","The next day she took a deep breath and decided: \"That was it. There's no way I'm going back.\" For more than 50 years, she had spent almost every night on a bus, plane, in a car or a hotel. \"There was only that life for me. And at some point, I didn't want to dance and sing anymore. I wanted to be at home and be normal.\"\n","\"Home\" was a villa near Küsnacht on Lake Zurich, where she had lived since the 1990s. The over one-acre estate in Switzerland, which she named \"Algonquin\" after her Native American grandmother, was a place where Tina enjoyed her retreat from show business alongside her German husband Erwin Bach.\n","For a long time, it remained a secret that she had been seriously ill in her later years of life. She survived a stroke, suffered from colon cancer and received a kidney transplant. The organ was donated by her husband in 2017, but before that, she had been dependent on dialysis for many years.\n","Nevertheless, Tina remained confident and recovered. The self-confessed Buddhist was never afraid of death. \"I don't believe in God and the Devil; that there's someone there who tells you what you did right and what you did wrong,\" she told German weekly Die Zeit in 2018. Turner was convinced that every deceased person begins a new life at some point. \"We go and take a break. And then we come back — and start over again,\" she believed. It was at her secluded home in Switzerland where the songstress reportedly passed away aged 83. \n","If she was right, she certainly deserves an easy start in her next life in reincarnation. Born on November 26, 1939, as Anna Mae Bullock, she grew up on a farm in the small town of Nutbush, Tennessee, where her father worked as an overseer of cotton pickers. Racial segregation still prevailed in the US, and as a child, she had to lower her glance when speaking to a white man: \"Yes Sir, no Sir\" was the expected way of speaking. On Sundays, Anna Mae sang in the church gospel choir.\n","In 1955, she moved to St. Louis, where her encounter with Ike Turner, a pioneer of soul music, was to change her life. The two met in a club where the then already popular Ike was holding court with his band, Kings of Rhythm. The then 17-year-old Anna Mae spontaneously grabbed the mike and sang a B.B. King hit. It was the beginning of an unprecedented career. Ike hired her right away as a background singer for his band.\n","She got her big opportunity in 1960 when Art Lassiter, the lead singer of the Ike Turner Band, was supposed to record the song \"A Fool in Love.\" But he failed to show, so Ike sent the young Anna Mae to the microphone instead. It was their very first hit ever, which made it to number 27 in the US charts. For promotion reasons, Ike renamed the young singer Tina without further ado, finally pulling her out of the background choir and placing her in the spotlight. From then on, they toured the country together as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.\n","Ike and Tina also became a couple. The musicians married in Mexico in 1962 and had two sons together. In the professional realm, their success rose steadily. Tina's impressive voice was also noticed in Europe when she contributed to Phil Spector's pop symphony \"River Deep, Mountain High\" in 1966 — for a fee of $25,000 (€23,200).\n","A joint tour with the Rolling Stones, regular shows in Las Vegas, a new lucrative record deal and higher fees for live performances marked the successful years of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue; each year, they played some 270 concerts.\n","The song \"Proud Mary\" catapulted them into the top 10 of the US charts for the first time in 1970. The single became a million-seller and Tina received her first Grammy Award as Best Rhythm & Blues Singer.\n","As an artist couple, Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the \"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\" in 1991 — even though they had long gone their separate ways.\n","In her 1986 biography, I, Tina: My Life Story, the singer described their marriage as hell on Earth. Ike constantly cheated on Tina and turned out to be a tyrant who put her in the hospital several times. In 1976, she pulled the plug: After a gig in Dallas, Tina fled the hotel suite with a swollen, bruised face and just 36 cents to her name and never returned. In the divorce, she renounced all rights and joint property, only taking her stage name with her. A name that would later bring her world fame.\n","But at first Tina had a hard time keeping her head above water. She was in debt due to the cancelled tour with Ike, who took all the royalties. She sang in bars and at business events, and also worked as a cleaning lady: \"To be free ... well, that was wonderful! I didn't care that I didn't have any money, that I had to clean other people's houses to earn a living,\" she later recalled of this challenging period.\n","The big record companies had written her off at that time as an old star who could hardly be marketed. But music producer and manager Roger Davies supported Tina. He believed in her and pulled her out of her career doldrums. With the album Private Dancer, Tina stepped back into the spotlight again in 1984 at the age of 45. The released single \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" became her first No. 1 hit.\n","From then on, the Queen of Rock could only move upward. In the course of her more than 50-year career, Tina Turner sold around 200 million albums and won 12 Grammy Awards. In 1988, she performed at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro in front of 180,000 people — this huge audience earned her an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records.\n","In 1985, she met music manager Erwin Bach, who was 16 years her junior, in Cologne, Germany. Even though it was love at first sight, the two of them did not get married until 2013, in a Buddhist ceremony. That was 51 years after her marriage to Ike. The wedding guests are said to have included David Bowie, Eros Ramazotti and Giorgio Armani. In that same year Tina Turner also took on Swiss citizenship.\n","After her retreat from the stage, she recorded Buddhist texts for a spiritual music project. In 2018, she was a consultant for the creators of the Tina Turner Musical. That same year, her memoirs My Love Story were published. That book shows that Tina Turner was not only a wonderful singer, but also a tireless fighter.\n","TV star host Oprah Winfrey, Tina's longtime friend, put it in a nutshell: \"Tina, you not only sing and dance. When people see you on stage, they know that you have fought your way out of the worst despair. That means no matter how far a woman has fallen, she can make it, just like you did.\"\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","This article was originally written in German.\n","'Rock icon Tina Turner dies aged 83 24.05.2023'\n","Tina Turner, widely known as the \"Queen of Rock 'n' Roll\" died on Wednesday at the age of 83, her representatives announced.\n","The US-born, Swiss-naturalized singer passed away in her home near Zurich after a long illness, her representatives said in a statement.\n","She was among the biggest recording artists of all time.

During the 20-year relationship, she was physically and emotionally abused — later leaving the relationship and becoming one of the first celebrities to speak frankly about domestic violence.\n","\n","She then became a superstar as a solo artist in her 40s, enjoying even wider success — known for her electric stage presence, powerful voice and shimmering costumes.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","rm, rmt/rs, jsi (Reuters, AP, dpa)\n","'German Diversity Day: How inclusive is the cultural world? 23.05.2023'\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Disabilities are multifaceted. From psychological to physical disabilities, there are many variations. In film, television and the arts, people with disabilities have become increasingly present in recent years and many artists who have a disability themselves are now open about it.\n","From \"Game of Thrones\" star Peter Dinklage who has achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that affects bone growth to pop icon Billie Eilish, who has Tourette's syndrome, to painter Yayoi Kusama, who lives with obsessive-compulsive disorder — more and more famous actors, artists and musicians with physical or cognitive challenges are garnering space in the spotlight.\n","In Germany, too, things are changing in the cultural world. Jutta Schubert, a project manager at Eucrea, an association focusing on art and artists with disabilities in German-speaking countries, sees some progress. She notes that diversity today is no longer limited to people with a migration background or people's sexual orientation but also includes people with disabilities.\n","\"In Germany, people with disabilities were completely forgotten or overlooked for a very long time,\" Schubert told DW. Part of the reason, she says, is that most federal funding programs for cultural institutions focused on other groups. \"People with disabilities have really only been at the center of the diversity issue for, I would say, one or two years.\"\n","Today, she says, it is clear from calls for bids for artistic projects, such as those of the \"Performing Arts Fund\" or the German Federal Cultural Foundation, that the issue of diversity is being perceived more comprehensively.\n","\"Institutions understand that they can secure financial support if they hire people with disabilities or promote accessibility,\" Schubert explains.\n","A new program called 'pik' was recently launched by the German Federal Cultural Foundation with the specific aim of promoting projects in this area. It aims to facilitate long-term collaborations between theaters and inclusive groups and also includes a mentoring program. \"Such a development would have been unfathomable eight or ten years ago,\" Schubert explains.\n","In addition, more and more cultural institutions are taking their own initiative in the area, especially in the theater sector. Schubert referred to the Munich Kammerspiele theater company, whose ensemble includes six people with disabilities. Other theaters are also showing interest in hiring people with disabilities for productions or even employing them permanently and integrating them into the ensemble.\n","\n","The film industry is also paying more attention to diversity. To generate realistic portrayals, German production companies such as UFA are now using actors with disabilities. In doing so, they are referring to the EU Platform of Diversity Charters, created in 2010.\n","\"When German production companies look for actresses or actors for roles that portray, for example, a person in a wheelchair with a migration background or someone with brittle bone disease, more attention is paid to not casting with actors without disabilities.\n","The German film industry has been inspired by developments in the US, where actors such as RJ Mitte (from \"Breaking Bad\") and Peter Dinklage (\"Game of Thrones \") have made careers for themselves. \n","\n","Even if they do not act as activists for people with disabilities, Schubert considers them role models. \"Peter Dinklage speaks very openly about his disability and also sometimes expresses himself in interviews about what changes need to happen.\" According to Schubert, this openness has a positive influence on the acceptance of people with disabilities in general society.\n","Apart from the theater and film industries, the museum landscape is also undergoing change. The 2017 exhibition \"Art and Alphabet\" at Hamburg's Kunsthalle is one example. It showcased the work of Harald Stoffers, a successful Hamburg painter with a cognitive disability. \"This painter, who works exclusively with writing, designed an entire room there,\" says Schubert.\n","A special award was created in Germany in 2000 for people with cognitive disabilities who create art. The Augustinum Foundation bestows the \"Euward\" — a made-up word combining \"Europe\" and \"award\" — every three years to European artists. The three honorees receive, among other things, an exhibition of their work at the Haus der Kunst in Munich, which gives their work visibility. This year, an Euward will be awarded again.\n","One of the biggest hurdles for people with disabilities is getting into the arts and culture business at all. \"For drama schools, disabilities were an exclusion criterion until a few years ago,\" says Schubert.\n","\n","But the schools are becoming more and more open, she adds. The association she works for has initiated its own program to promote inclusion in arts education. So far, universities with visual and performing arts programs from five German states are participating. In 2024, the program is to be expanded to other German states.\n","When Schubert compares all the inclusion efforts in the cultural sector that have been undertaken in Germany in recent years with those in neighboring countries or even in Great Britain, she nevertheless concludes that there is \"still a great deal of catching up to do\" in this country.\n","This article was originally written in German. \n","\"Five lessons from Meron Mendel's 'Talking about Israel' 15.05.2023\"\n","Meron Mendel's new book, \"Über Israel reden\" (\"Talking about Israel\"), examines how Israel is debated in Germany. \n","A descendant of Holocaust survivors, Mendel was born in 1976 and grew up on a kibbutz in Israel. He emigrated to Germany in 2003. Since 2010, he has been the director of the Anne Frank Educational Center in Frankfurt.\n","Here are five ideas from his book.\n","In his new book, Mendel analyzes various debates and controversies about representations of Israel in Germany. \n","For example, he revisits the controversy around Cameroonian historian and political scientist Achille Mbembe, who was invited to open the Ruhrtriennale music and arts festival in western Germany in 2020, but whose keynote was canceled when he compared the state of Israel with South Africa's apartheid regime. \n","Other debates that are analyzed in the book include the German Bundestag's resolution against the anti-Israel Boycott, Divest, Sanction (BDS) movement in 2019, and the scandal surrounding antisemitic art displayed at the international Documenta art show in 2022.\n","Mendel describes how he, as an Israeli and a Jew, has been used as a tool for very different purposes. In Germany, he writes, the focus is taking a stance on Israel-related issues as opposed to a nuanced conversation — or even critically questioning one's own stance.\n","Every German's position on the Israel-Palestine question is \"an identity-forming question par excellence.\" It comes before any other discussion, virtually as a kind of \"psychological test,\" he says.\n","\n","Mendel asks how the antisemitic representations at Documenta could be better recognized and discussed rather than just scandalized? He feels there should have been more space for debate and differentiated perspectives in reaction to the controversy. Without this approach, he fears, the same story will repeat itself in a similar setting. \n","Mendel portrays his own experiences throughout the book. Having emphasized that antisemitism in Germany is not merely a Muslim issue, he has become the target of pro-Israel groups who accuse him of \"relativizing Muslim antisemitism.\" Some have described Mendel as a \"notorious antisemitism denier.\"\n","His criticisms of Israeli policies have not been well-received either. \n","While Mendel remembers his friendly welcome when arriving in Germany over two decades ago, he recalls that: \"When it became clear that I was much more critical about current politics in Israel and discussed that in my view, the Muslim minority is not the main threat to Jews in Germany, I was instantly declared an enemy.\"\n","Mendel criticizes this \"black-and-white thinking\" where you can either be for or against Israel. For him, instead of trying to determine which side is right or wrong, a more central question should be trying to determine how moderate forces from both the Israeli and the Palestinian side can be supported.\n","Mendel urges self-reflection as a first measure when questions arise in Germany about Israel and the Middle East conflict.\n","For example, in the current heated discussion about Israel's settlement policy, where comparisons with the Nazi regime are sometimes made, it seems for many Germans \"to be a relief to be able to label Jews in an unfamiliar reversed role as 'perpetrators'.\" This, he says, can allow Germans \"to distance themselves from their own responsibility without having to deal with it.\"\n","He adds that reversing the roles of the victims and the perpetrators can offer some relief from a German perspective: \"After all, the Jews are just as bad as our own ancestors!\"\n","\"This exoneration strategy, which first emerged among right-wing radicals, is now also found in well-educated circles of people who see themselves as historically conscious and left-wing,\" Mendel adds. \n","As a trained historian, Mendel sees comparisons as a natural means of observation and analysis.\n","But equating the Shoah and the Nakba — meaning \"catastrophe\" in Arabic, this is remembered on May 15, the start of the Arab-Israel War in 1948 when some 700,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homeland — is not historically tenable, says Mendel.\n","\"Behind the claim is the urge to delegitimize the very existence of the state of Israel,\" he argues.\n","Mendel repeatedly emphasizes the importance of recognizing the suffering of different victims of violence (not least that of Palestinians). \"The call for more empathy toward the 'other' is in itself to be applauded,\" he says. \"But it is significant that it often goes hand-in-hand with a lack of empathy toward Jews, who are seen as the privileged others.\"\n","Critics accuse Israel of treating Palestinians with the approach of an imperial colonial state. This diminishes the significance of the Shoah as the event leading to the founding of the Israeli state, Mendel believes.  \n","Empathy is not created by comparing the death toll in Auschwitz to the death toll in the Omaheke desert — when German colonizers massacred local Herero and Nama people in Namibia in the early 1900s in what has been called a genocide. \n","According to Mendel, such comparisons are based on the \"desire to 'normalize' the German discourse on Israel, to condemn Israel harshly without having to take into account its historic origins.\" In other words, to present Israel as just one colonial state among many.\n","Other injustices do not have to be understood by way of comparison, he says. \"The suffering of other groups or individuals and their commemoration is not affected by the memory of the Holocaust.\"\n","Mendel concludes that German accountability for Israel today could involve taking a clear stand against right-wing extremism, \"even if it occurs in the Israeli cabinet.\"\n","\"Talking about Israel\" could become a new German virtue, an art of \"criticizing without negating one's own responsibility,\" he suggests.\n","This article was adapted

decades ago 24.08.2023 ****'\n","The first games were played on Saturday August 24 1963  all eight games No Friday Sunday or God forbid Monday fixtures The decision to establish a single toptier league of 16 clubs in West Germany had been made at a national congress of the German Football Association DFB held in Dortmund in July 1962\n","This decision makes me happy At last we have it West Germany coach Sepp Herberger who had been a congress delegate representing the Southwest German Football Association said at the time according to the DFB Journal\n","This made West Germany one of the last major European countries to get a single toptier league Englands Football League which became the Premier League in 1992 had already been founded long before in 1892 Italys Serie A kicked off its first campaign in 1898 Spains Primera Division in 1929 and Frances Ligue 1 followed in 1932 Even the other Germany was far quicker to establish a top tier league than West Germany The Oberliga began play in 1949 before the state of East Germany had even been officially founded\n","Many had grown tired of a rather cumbersome system that the DFB had used to determine Germanys football champion since 1903 Under that system the champions of the regional leagues at first eight later 16 would face each other in a knockout tournament to determine the national champion\n","The disadvantage to this system though was that it meant the countrys top teams in any given era or season would only face each other once a year Many also argued that a single toptier national league running over an entire season was a fairer way to determine a champion rather than a twolegged knockout tournament  in which in theory at least a lesser team could win the title by hitting a strong run of form at just the right time The Bundesliga would change all of that\n","Clubs had to apply to the DFB for admission to the Bundesliga for its inaugural season A total of 46 of the 74 clubs in West Germanys top regional leagues Oberliga did so The DFB had predetermined a system meant to distribute the teams over the entire country Three would come from the north five each from the west and south two from the southwest and one from West Berlin\n","The selection which was made by a fivemember Bundesliga commission was based on sporting economic and technical criteria A major factor was a clubs performance in the Oberliga over the previous 12 seasons While several clubs were named to join this new league without dispute several others were cause for considerable controversy Much of the reason for this was that the commission didnt always strictly follow its own criteria in determining which clubs to invite\n","To smooth things over with some of those who were excluded the idea of increasing the number of teams in the inaugural season to 18 or even 20 was raised but ultimately rejected A total of 13 of the clubs that didnt make the final cut lodged protests with the DFB  all of which were unsuccessful It may seem hard to imagine in 2023 but among these were a certain Bayern Munich\n","The founding members of the Bundesliga were Hamburg Werder Bremen and Eintracht Braunschweig from the north Eintracht Frankfurt Karlsruhe Nuremberg 1860 Munich and VfB Stuttgart from the south Borussia Dortmund Cologne Meidericher SV better known as Duisburg Preussen Mnster and Schalke from the west Kaiserslautern and Saarbrcken were admitted from the southwest Hertha were chosen to represent West Berlin  a decision made more for political than for footballing reasons The honor of becoming the Bundesligas first champions went to Cologne\n","The next major change came in 1991 Germanys reunification led to an effort to integrate East German football into a united league system As a result the last East German Oberliga champions Hansa Rostock joined the Bundesliga for the 199192 season along with secondplaced Dynamo Dresden  with the league expanding to 20 teams for a single campaign At the end of the season four were relegated  including Hansa Rostock  and just two promoted from the second tier bringing the Bundesliga back to 18 clubs\n","1 Todays perennial

Nelson Chamisa to usher in a better future the CCC has struggled to establish its candidates in rural areas that are traditional ZANU PF strongholds Farai Muroiwa Marapira director of information and

told DW We have a lot of youth vying to represent ZANU PF and I believe a lot of youths were actually representing the party at ward and parliamentary elections Marapira said stressing that their political rallies had seen massive youth attendance \n","Generational differences have defined the election campaign 80yearold President Mnangagwa is the older of the two main candidates In addition ZANU PF also celebrates its 60th founding anniversary in August The party long associated with the late President Robert Mugabe has used the occasion to recall its origins as an anticolonial liberation movement and denounce the opposition as Western puppets\n","According to Farai Muroiwa Marapira the party attracts a lot of interest from the youth\n","More than 50 of attendance at the end of the rally was mostly the youth Marapira noted adding that they are quite happy and hope to continue attracting more youth because the policies of the president Mnagangwa that are youth and gendercentered The results are there for all to see The youths are very much a part of ZANU PF which is a progressive party\n","Also hoping to clinch the youth vote is the CCC which promises new

party and our countrys politics 30yearold Gift Ostallos Siziba the CCCs spokesperson told DW Those between the ages of 18 and 35 are the major victims of the political crisis in our country which has moved into an economic crisis Siziba described the life young people in Zimbabwe as a life with empty stomachs and a jobless existence\n","According to official figures Zimbabwes youths constitute about 68 of the countrys population and about 75 of the voters In addition about 70 of Zimbabwes youths are unemployed Siziba told DW that the solution in our country is to vote for the president Chamisa\n","According to Siziba CCC encourages youth to participate in politics actively\n","Look at the positions of parliament members in Harare Bulawayo and different parts of the province Manicaland You see the representation of women and young people Siziba said Those were central philosophical state points for the CCC so we are doing all so that we become a home for the younger people a home for the oppressed who are in the center of the national democratic project we are executing\n","According to Bhebe the youth rarely has a chance to participate in politics The number of youth contesting in the 2023 elections is very low largely because they were sidelined and in some instances elbowed out by senior political party members the human rights and governance expert said\n","The presidential age limit is clearly stated in the constitution and for that to be changed to accommodate youths with a desire to run for the presidency at a much younger age then a law reform would be essential But as long as the youth are sidelined in policy making and governance their voices will continue to be muzzled she explained\n","However some of the young voters have

early 2020 to which 810 women were invited The reports alleged that the party wound up being an orgy and Rubiales subsequently billed it as a work event Both the RFEF and its boss have denied the allegations\n","Rubiales postmatch actions have wound up overshadowing a sporting success no one would have thought possible just nine months ago This is because by the end of September 2022 there was essentially no team left after 15 players temporarily quit the national team in protest The reason they gave was their emotional and therefore overall health which made it impossible for them to participate in the national teams games until the situation was corrected\n","At the time the main reason was apparently coach Jorge Vilda The players who revolted accused him of failing to respect their privacy ignoring the reserve players and in general not creating a professional environment around the national team A public dispute ensued with the RFEF which supported Vilda and threatened

paintings drawings and sculptures The mix of genres is as varied as the range of artistic personalities which includes musicians actors writers sports stars and politicans\n","How did he come up with the idea for the show We thought it was exciting to see all the people who were involved with art Bieber told DW He admits that with celebrities making visual art is often a marketing stunt Ed Sheeran did an action painting once and Britney Spears once did some flower paintings while wearing a bikini he pointed out For Beyond Fame however he says he chose people who take art seriously\n","He says there are big surprises among them  works by German singer Tim Bendzko for example or even former tennis pro Michael Stich that have never been shown in a museum before You wouldnt think theyd paint like that None of the selected artists had ever attended an art academy he said We want to leave judgment of the works to our audience Bieber says Were excited to see the reactions\n","We cultivate Joseph Beuys expanded concept of art here explains Bieber which asserts that everyone is an artist One example he says is former Wimbledon champion Stich After retiring from tennis he took up painting as a hobby studied art history for two semesters and set up a studio Stich said it took him 10 years before he went public with his paintings My art is a reflection of my personality and my emotions as the exhibition organizers quote the former tennis pro\n","The paths the selected personalities have taken to artistic expression are as varied as the people themselves are And their choice of artistic medium is sometimes surprising Some works are closely linked to their respective biographies Some artists are at home in several creative fields at once One of them is the German theater actress author and visual artist Lea Drager She draws images of popes male and female with which she questions patriarchal systems and hierarchical structures Fellow German actress Meret Becker is active as a singer actress and visual artist Her work deals with social issues and she also campaigns for womens rights\n","Musicians like Bryan Adams and Peter Doherty have sold millions of albums  and theyve been creating visual art for many years Good photographs are like time capsules that store memories Adams told the Dsseldorf museum Doherty the scandalridden singer of British band The Libertines sees art  along with poetry  as an expressive way to process his life He works with blood and charcoal combining drawing painting sculpture and collages of images and text\n","The works by Canadian musician Claire Elise Boucher aka Grimes are populated by the kinds of fantasy figures  nymphs cyborgs and manga characters  that she also portrays herself as in her music videos According to the museum she draws inspiration for her drawings and album covers from mythical and psychedelic images borrowing figures and motifs from Art Nouveau and Surrealism and has recently begun using artificial intelligence\n","Whether as a counterbalance or a complement people in politics also engage in artistic activities For example German Green Party politician Anton Hofreiter makes no secret of his enthusiasm for\n","nature He earned a PhD in botany at the start of his political career and he paints and draws flowers For him as the museum says this is a way of recognizing how things really are\n","Beyond Fame promises to arouse curiosity about littleknown facets of prominent contemporaries Some of our artists promises curator Bieber should soon be on view in other museums For the

her many qualities it is Sarina Wiegmans constant composure that stands out Even as her England side suffered defeat in the 2023 World Cup final just as her Netherlands team had four years earlier she stayed calm strolling across the pitch to her crushed players before heading to the Spain bench to congratulate the winners\n","Shes given us the confidence to believe in ourselves and a lot of calmness in situations where weve been put under pressure England defender Lucy Bronze explained to DW \n","Though she has fallen short on the global stage Wiegman has won the last two European Championships with England in 2022 and her native Netherlands in 2017 \n","But its not just success that makes Wiegman an outlier She was the only female coach to make the quarterfinals of this tournament and one of only 12 that started it That is a figure higher than 2019 nine and 2015 eight though both of those World Cups had eight fewer teams The ratio of female to male coaches is not changing much\n","It would be nice if the balance gets better and we need to work to make it better UEFA doing that FIFA doing that federations need to do that and also give women opportunities she said in answer to a DW question after the 2023 final in Sydney \n","Jill Ellis who won the previous two tournaments with the USA agrees She told DW that such discrepancies are the result of opportunity deficit\n","I think women can execute at the top level I think what youre seeing in terms of the numbers is weve got to continue to create and invest in opportunities We cant assign a head coach just because shes a female we have to make sure that theres support around or that shes educated to be ready for that position when it arrives she said\n","The success of coaches like Wiegman and Ellis has so far not led to female coaches taking charge of prominent mens sides in the same way men often coach women While Wiegmans links with the England mens job seem speculative for now Ellis said its only a matter of time until that changes\n","I dont think its far away at all she continued Weve seen it in the US in other sports Weve had assistant coaches in NFL American Football Major League Baseball NBA Basketball I think it should be almost genderless if youre a good coach youre a good coach Its about the grassroots In the US for example we hardly have any females on the sidelines of the youth\n","I think its because its a tough environment Parents are hard in there sometimes criticizing People sometimes think that a great coach is someone screaming and yelling because theyre doing something And so I dont think we see females in that area and then therefore theyre not cutting their teeth at an early age\n","While this World Cup and last years EUROs in England have seen the profile of the game skyrocket and participation numbers soar among girls those changes dont appear to quite be filtering through to coaches A FIFA survey in 2019 found more than 13 million girls and women played the sport but only 7 of coaches worldwide were women\n","It helps to see women on the stage both on and off the pitch because what you can see you can be said Wiegman in her prefinal press conference\n","Of course what we hope is to get more female football coaches at the top level and the balance gets better than it is right now she had said earlier in the knockout stages Of course males are welcome too There are lots of males who have done a very good job in the womens game but if the balance is better that will also inspire other women to start coaching\n","Though FIFA have not always been quick to grow the womens game Ellis pointed to a program from world footballs governing body that mandates there must be a female coach or assistant at youth World Cups It is too early to judge the success of that But there are still genderbased obstacles even for those who navigate the complex path to the top dugouts like Chelsea coach Emma Hayes\n","Youre going to be held to the highest expectations Its not good enough just to win it has to look perfect in almost everything Hayes who has won dozens of trophies with the English club and was named FIFAs Best Coach in 2021 told a panel at an event in Sydney shortly before the World Cup final\n","Maybe Ive just come to accept that scrutiny over the years and with age its got easier continued When I think about being a head coach when I was in Chicago Red Stars 200810 these were the days when Twitter first started and I was overwhelmed with that Early on in my career I struggled with it Now I just have processes in place Clear Rules I wont read social media for one reason and that is that I think is important to protect your own confidence\n","Wiegmans confidence is unlikely to have taken too much of a dent in Australia and neither has her reputation She will no doubt be an inspiration to many but its clear there is still plenty of work to do\n","It is still necessary to do more to get more females involved Wiegman concluded I hope everyone has seen again that women and girls are inspired that they can coach or play She is not alone in that hope\n","Edited by Michael

Hemp slipped past Ellie Carpenter to restore Englands lead eight minutes later Kerr puffed out her cheeks on the halfway line It was not to be the last time her face would betray her frustration with two late missed chances punished by Alessia Russo after stunning work from Hemp As the final whistle blew the Australian captain bent double hands on her knees the weight of a nation on her shoulders\n","Thats usually my bread and butter said Kerr of her missed opportunities But unfortunately this World Cup hasnt gone as planned\n","Given her hardrunning display and starting berth it was almost possible to forget about Kerrs calf The injury that dominated the opening weeks of the tournament had faded in significance as the Matildas blasted cruised and then edged their way further than theyd ever been before\n","But as in the last round against Colombia and their army of fans England were in no mood to lay out the drinks and nibbles for a Stadium Australia party\n","Were such an experienced squad Hemp said in response to a question from DW in the postmatch press conference We faced part of that in the Colombia game the fans were absolutely wild they were unbelievable I felt like the Australian fans were unbelievable again and it was a fantastic atmosphere But even after Sams goal I feel like there was no fear in the squad We werent nervous we just played our football I think that showed the relentlessness inside the squad\n","And for all the noise early on Australia seemed in no real hurry to provide the entertainment The hosts sat off England allowing the European champions to dictate the tempo until their captain briefly set a new tone\n","By that time Ella Toone ensured England had something more concrete Hemp and Russo kept a throwin alive long enough for Toone to run onto the loose ball and slice a sweet strike home\n","Given the impact of Lauren James earlier in the tournament Toone would almost certainly have been starting this one on the bench but for James sending off against Nigeria It isnt the first time Toone has made an impact as a replacement scoring the opener in Englands Euros final win from the bench with an equally memorable strike a year ago\n","With three successive World Cup semifinals and that Euros win as well as Englands investment in womens football  from grassroots through the Womens Super League WSL to the expensive appointment of coach Sarina Wiegman and a wellresourced senior team  the foundations are well established With Wiegman as their architect Englands house is looking well in order\n","Australia will hope that this tournament a success in every way will enable them to follow suit\n","Its been amazing to see the reaction from the Australian public to what weve been doing said Australias Steph Catley Particularly from where weve come from You couldnt find a more appreciative group than us It has been so special\n","Though in a better spot than many at this tournament a crowded sporting landscape in Australia has often seen football pushed aside with a domestic league that struggles to retain its best players  a major challenge yet to be solved\n","Important as it is questions of legacy are for another day For now the players in green and gold are left with a mixture of pride and frustration that their opponents were until recently all too familiar with\n","The optimists in the Sydney stands Melbourne fan parks and Perth pubs will believe this team can improve Others may struggle to see a better chance than a home tournament Kerr at the end appeared to be in the latter camp\n","Edited by Chuck Penfold\n","\n","\n","'*** United planned Greenwood return amid fan protests: reports 16.08.2023 ****'\n","Manchester United began the 202324 Premier League season with a narrow 10 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford on Monday night a match preceded by supporter protests against the potential return of striker Mason Greenwood\n","Greenwood 21 was arrested in January 2022 after an audio recording emerged on social media of an alleged sexual assault accompanied by images and video footage of apparent injuries\n","Following a police investigation Greenwood was charged with attempted rape controlling and coercive behavior and assault occasioning actual bodily harm all of which the player denied\n","In February 2023 the United Kingdoms Crown Prosecution Service dropped its case against him saying that a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction\n","Greenwood has been suspended by Manchester United since his arrest The club has also been conducting its own internal investigation before deciding whether or not to allow him to return to the first team for whom he scored 35 goals across twoandahalf seasons from 2019 to 2022\n","A decision was expected to have been made by the start of the new season and as The Athletic reported on Wednesday August 16 it was expected to be that Greenwood would be allowed to return\n","According to The Athletic the intended date for the announcement was to be Friday August 4 and it was intended to involve a video in which Uniteds chief executive Richard Arnold would explain the decision to both club employees and the general public\n","Arnold was reportedly expected to explain that Greenwood would be brought back into the firstteam setup but would not be doing any work with the Manchester United Foundation the clubs charitable arm in the shorttomedium term\n","However the announcement did not go ahead \n","Later on August 16 United made their first public statement on the issue saying The factfinding phase of our investigation is now complete and we are in the final stages of making a decision on Masons future Contrary to media speculation a decision has not yet been made and is currently the subject of intensive internal deliberation\n","The club also acknowledged strong opinions provoked by what it called partial evidence in the public domain adding that its own investigation had drawn on extensive evidence and context not in the public domain\n","Finally the club confirmed reports that its final decision would be communicated and explained to internal and external stakeholders  believed according to widespread British media reports to include major sponsors the clubs fan advisory board and its womens team three of whom are currently representing England at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand\n","Before and after Englands quarterfinal win over Colombia goalkeeper Mary Earps and midfielders Ella Toone and Katie Zelem were targeted on social media by apparent Manchester United fans petitioning them to support Greenwoods return\n","On the ground in Manchester however other female supporters organized a demonstration ahead of the Wolves game behind a banner reading Female fans demand no Greenwood return End violence against women\n","The message to Manchester United is Think about what youre doing History is going to judge you One of the organizers who are all longtime United season ticket holders told The News Movement outside Old Trafford\n","We feel that there is a lot at stake here Footballers are huge role models for children and young people Does Mason Greenwood deserve to earn a living Yes Should that be at Manchester United where hes a role model to millions of children and young people across the world Absolutely not\n","While other male fans agreed one countered The police have had a go and the charges have been dropped so for me nothing has happened and theres no case to answer\n","To that argument another protester giving her name just as Em told The News Agents podcast\n","A process is a process and a contract is a contract but for me this is not a contract issue its an ethics issue a morality issue If we want to move the sport forward in terms of proper respect for diversity and inclusion then you have to take a more grownup stance and back the supporters\n","Another protest organizer told The Athletic This is a tipping point for the club Are they going to side with commercialism and trophies and money Or are they going to take the side of matchgoing fans and the club being a social and community institution that we can be proud of and proud to have as part of our identity\n","The discrepancy between opinions voiced often anonymously online and those held by people on the ground is an increasingly common one in modern professional football\n","Just in the last month in Germany a section of Borussia Dortmund supporters raised objections to the signing of midfielder Felix Nmecha who had drawn criticism for a series of homophobic social media posts\n","But the issue is particularly acute in Englands Premier League where clubs make billions of dollars from global broadcast rights and sponsorship deals but still rely on local supporters to actually physically attend their matches in the cities where they are based\n","A similar split can also be observed on issues such as kickoff times being scheduled particularly early or late to suit television audiences the prospect of a European or even global Super League and most acutely in the case of Manchester United in recent months the issue of a potential sale of the club to Qatar\n","My primary sense is that in Manchester among those supporters who go to the games people dont want Greenwood to play but how that plays out on social media and across the rest of the world Im not too sure summarized Em who also called for more vocal support from Uniteds male supporters\n","There is support and there is vocal support she said As so often its women leading this but Id like to see more men be vocal about it Some of them are and were grateful for that But theres a lot of silent acceptance\n","With Uniteds England internationals set to remain in Australia for the Womens World Cup final on August 20 a decision from the club on Greenwood in consultation with the womens team has been put back\n","Indeed with the England players then set to go on holiday its possible that an announcement wont be made until the September international break\n","Either way it is understood that while the womens team and other stakeholders will be asked for their opinions those opinions wont ultimately reflect the final decision which will be made by chief executive Richard Arnold based on the outcome of the clubs internal investigation\n","Asked during Uniteds preseason tour of the United States earlier this month head coach Erik Ten Hag said Of course I have said my ideas and opinions but its a club decision We all have to accept that\n","Potentially still short of a striker despite the signing of Danish forward Rasmus Hojlund it is understood that Ten Hag is open to the idea of Greenwood bolstering his squads attacking options\n","Further complicating matters is Uniteds current financial situation With the club having recently been fined 300000 327850 by the European governing body UEFA for what the club described as a minor breakeven deficit during the fouryear period 20192022 the return of a prolific young striker who is already contracted to the club has an obvious sporting and financial attraction\n","The question being asked by those United supporters protesting outside Old Trafford is therefore what is more important\n","Edited by Chuck Penfold\n","\n","\n","('*** EU lawmakers want anti-war declaration for Russian and Belarusian '\n"," 'athletes 15.08.2023 ****')\n","A group of members of the European Parliament have called on the International Olympic Committee IOC to introduce an antiwar declaration for Russians and Belarusians wanting to compete at next years Paris Olympics\n","The IOC says it is yet to decide whether athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus can participate in the Games although it has recommended that international sports federations allow some to take part in Olympic qualifying events as neutrals citing their human rights\n","In a letter to the IOCs president Thomas Bach the MEPs demanded more clarity on the conditions for participation and suggested that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be required to sign a statutory document declaring their opposition to Russias war in Ukraine\n","By signing athletes would publicly condemn any aggression against any of the UN United Nations member states the group of 39 MEPs wrote in the letter dated July 21\n","Last month with a year to go before the Paris Olympics the IOC omitted Russia and Belarus from its official list of Games invitees but the possibility remains for Russians and Belarusians to compete in the French capital as Individual Neutral Athletes\n","Though we appreciate not sending official invitations to Russian and Belarusian athletes it is simply not enough the MEPs added The IOCs efforts must go further and not settle on using neutral flags\n","In May sports ministers from more than 30 countries raised concerns that the IOCs current recommendations  which exclude teams from Russia and Belarus as well as anyone who has actively supported the war or who is contracted to the military  were open to exploitation\n","While some aspects  have been addressed by the IOC there are substantial issues remaining not least around military connections of athletes state funding the definition of what constitutes teams and on enforcement mechanisms the ministers said in a joint statement\n","Signing an antiwar declaration would appear to be a nogo for Russia with the countrys sports minister threatening an allout boycott of the Olympics if that were to be a requirement for participation\n","There is a red line No one will sign any declarations to condemn the special military operation and so on Oleg Matytsin the sports minister told Russias parliament last month in comments reported by the Russian state news agency TASS Our athletes will not participate on such terms\n","However the group of MEPs made up of politicians from all the main parliamentary parties and from 15 countries including Germany Poland and the Czech Republic warned that the absence of a declaration could result in athletes being used by both regimes for propaganda purposes\n","It is usual for dictators and authoritarian regimes to weaponise sport as an instrument of expanding their influence the MEPs wrote For Russia and the Putin regime sport is primarily a political tool this has been clearly demonstrated by the fact that Russia has a statesponsored doping programme\n","Under the current conditions the participation of Russia and Belarus including the teams and support personnel representing these countries is inadmissible while the aggression against Ukraine is ongoing\n","DW asked the IOC for comment on the letter but was referred to a QA document on the Olympics website where the IOC labeled political interference in sport as deplorable and complained that its autonomy is being undermined by some governments\n","However in their letter the MEPs say that the organization should follow its own Olympic Charter which aims to use sport to promote a peaceful society\n","The IOC thus has to take a clear stance in order not to distance itself from its own values and ignore tens of thousands of Ukrainian casualties many of them innocent civilians children but also athletes the MEPs wrote\n","A decision of such importance cannot be simply devaluated by repeating the principle of political neutrality\n","Edited by Chuck Penfold\n","\n","\n","(\"*** Women's World Cup sees attendance and TV-rating records tumble \"\n"," '13.08.2023 ****')\n","The noise was immense As Hannah Wilkinson netted the winner for New Zealand in the 2023 Womens World Cup opener against Norway about 42000 Kiwis went wild\n","It was the biggest crowd to watch a football match in New Zealand mens or womens smashing the previous womens record by 26000 A few hours later Australia followed suit as almost 75000 fans cheered on the Matildas 10 win over Ireland\n","Now as the semifinals approach ticket sales are expected to hit 198 million for the entire tournament which would equate to an average of 31000 fans attending each of the 64 matches\n","That has easily eclipsed the previous record of 135 million at the 2015 World Cup in Canada which averaged out to 26000 fans per game \n","It should be noted though that in 2015 only 24 teams were involved as opposed to the current 32 This means just 52 matches were played instead of the 64 at this years tournament Another factor that may have contributed to the higher numbers is the fact that this time there have been two host nations instead of one  even if New Zealand failed to get to the knockout stage\n","Considering that the initial target was 13 million and later increased to 15 million the attendance represents a massive success for the host nations Football has simply exploded in Australia and New Zealand over the past month and global interest has been equally impressive\n","Australia may be a fanatical sporting nation but soccer has always struggled for widespread attention against rugby and Australian rules football which dominate the media headlines and TV ratings\n","Yet the Matildas roundof16 match against Denmark

home crowd theyre boosting us through this tournament winger Caitlin Foord said All credit to them being loud and being there for us\n","New Zealand fared a little less well statistically with about 700000 tickets sold at an average of 24500 per match \n","Fixtures in Auckland and Wellington were very well attended but the decision to hold matches in Dunedin with a population of just 129000 dragged the numbers down significantly The stadium didnt reach 50 capacity across its six games though it did sell out for New Zealands draw with Switzerland\n","Considering the nations obsession with rugby however and its population of just five million the numbers outperformed expectations with the record for the largest crowd for a football match in the country being broken three times in Auckland\n","The noise was deafening New Zealand cocaptain Ria Percival told DW after the Football Ferns opening day win over Norway Ive never heard anything like that and I cannot believe so many people came to watch us play It was amazing\n","Defender Claudia Bunge said I never dreamed of playing in front of a soldout crowd at Eden Park I hope just being a part of this piece of history has inspired all the little girls watching in the stadiums or at home to go out and be a part of the next generation of the Ferns\n","Though the hosts failed to reach the knockout stages New Zealanders

five games and we wish it was more\n","We have loved the excitement bright colors and songs that all the different fans have brought Scott said Even when it was a smaller crowd you find a team like Zambia who had a singing section that just never stopped\n","Cynical suggestions that free tickets may have boosted numbers also hold no water with just 20000 given away across all four New Zealand cities\n","TV ratings have been equally as impressive especially with most of the matches being shown on Sky and only a handful being streamed for free on Stuffnz\n","More than 1 million people turned on the teams opener against Norway during the course of the match more than any figure for a mens World Cup match on record\n","There have been impressive numbers worldwide as well especially considering that many games are outside traditional primetime slots in many markets\n","Despite a 500 am start in the Eastern time zone of the United States the USWNTs last16 defeat on penalties to

death \"\n"," '29.12.2023 ****')\n","Leaving behind a legacy of 700 constructions in 30 countries visionary French engineer Gustave Eiffel died 100 years ago on December 27 1923 in Paris at the age of 91\n","His name is of course most directly associated with the Eiffel Tower built for the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris The landmark structure has since become the symbol of the French capital and one of the worlds mostvisited attractions\n","It is only through a quirk of history however that the striking tower bears the name of Gustave Eiffel or that it is even standing today\n","The engineer was initially not enthusiastic about the structure designed by Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nougier colleagues in his construction company Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel\n","Thats why Eiffel involved his chief architect Stephen Sauvestre in the planning The number of floors were reduced from six to three while Sauvestre changed the position of the foundations and added the striking round arch under the first platform\n","Eiffel Koechlin and Nougier jointly applied for a patent on the design principle Eventually Eiffel bought the copyrights from his employees\n","The structure was subsequently named Eiffel Tower But it could also have been called the Koechlin  Nougier Tower or the Sauvestre Tower Who remembers them today\n","Critics initially disparaged the design as a tragic lamppost a disgusting ink stain or the disgrace of Paris\n","An open letter against the project was published in the magazine Les Temps on February 14 1887\n","We writers painters sculptors architects and passionate lovers of the still intact beauty of Paris protest with all our strength and indignation in the name of misunderstood French taste in the name of art and threatened French history against the construction of the useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower the letter stated\n","Among the signatories were writers such as Guy de Maupassant Leconte de Lisle Charles Gounod and Alexandre Dumas \n","The latter criticized the dizzying ridiculousness of the tower which would dominate the city like a gigantic black factory chimney and overwhelm the architecture with its barbaric mass\n","But the idea of the tower caught on and Eiffel was able to quickly realize the construction which consisted of 18000 individual parts\n","He even took on a large part of the financing by securing the lucrative usage rights for 20 years Peoples curiosity about the monumental halftimbered tower was huge from the start\n","Eiffel who was born in Dijon on December 15 1832 perhaps inherited his business savy from his mother Catherine Moneuse\n","The daughter of a timber merchant she had invested in the booming hard coal business and the familys wealth grew massively within a short period of time\n","In 1856 Gustave entered the service of Charles Nepveu a civil engineering contractor and by his mid20s the young Eiffel was already the construction manager of one the largest construction sites in France the Bordeaux railway bridge\n","Things got off to a good start for Eiffel professionally but he was still single in his 30s and wrote to his mother that he needed a neat housewife who wont pester me too much His mother found a match for him 17yearold Marie Gaudelet whom he soon married\n","The young Eiffels constructions were in demand everywhere He soon built churches in the Philippines and Peru the Western Railway Station in Budapest bridges in Vietnam and the iron framework of the Statue of Liberty in New York\n","The plan was to demolish the Eiffel Tower once Gustave Eiffels 20year permit to use the land had expired\n","However the engineer wanted to have his masterpiece preserved for posterity Early on he started searching for a scientific purpose for the tower that would justify its existence\n","He set up a meteorological and an astronomical observation station while scientific experiments were carried out there also\n","In 1898 the

****')\n","Hirayama the protagonist of Wim Wenders new film Perfect Days is a man of strict routines\n","Rising every day before dawn he carefully trims his mustache lovingly waters his plants dug from the grounds of a nearby shrine climbs into his old van and drives to work On the way he listens to a cassette from his extensive collection of 60s and 70s rock classics The Rolling Stones Otis Redding the Kinks and of course given the films title Lou Reed\n","Hirayamas job is cleaning the public restrooms in Toykos Shibuya district His work  all the scrubbing sponging brushing and mopping  isnt glamorous but it is an important service and Hirayama played with effortless cool dignity by Japanese screen legend Yakusho Koji goes about it with the same consciousness and careful attention to detail we see in every moment of his day \n","The toilets themselves are frankly beautiful One is bright white dome like a landed spaceship Another resembles a labyrinth of wooden planks One has brightly colored but transparent walls When an American woman clearly confused asks how it works Hirayama without a word slips inside and locks the door The glass turns opaque\n","Every one of the buildings featured in Perfect Days is an actual public toilet part of an architecture project to renovate the facilities in Tokyos Shibuya ward\n","When the Nippon Foundation started the Tokyo Toilet Project in 2018 it was says project coordinator Yamada Akiko to counter the image of public toilets as dark dirty smelly and scary\n","Some of the countrys leading architects including Ban Shigeru winner of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize and Kengo Kuma the awardwinning designer of the VA Dundee museum reinvented the idea of the public toilet with advanced designs for 17 WCs in the Shibuya area created not just to be works of art but also structured to be accessible for everyone regardless of gender age or disability\n","More than just a public service the project is a way of moving toward the realization of a society that embraces diversity says the Nippon Foundation \n","The Shibuya district contacted Wim Wenders asking if he would make a documentary about the project Wenders has a long and intimate connection to Japan The German director cites TokyoStory 1953 from Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu as one of main reasons he became a filmmaker  In 1985 he made a documentary on Ozu TokyoGa Four years later he made Notebook on Cities and Clothes another Japaneseset documentary about fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto \n","But for Wenders the Tokyo Toilet Project was about more than architecture it was about something deep in Japanese culture Instead of a documentary he decided to make a feature drama with the Tokyo Toilet Project at its core \n","On the one hand there is the strong feeling of service and the common good in Japan Wenders said in a recent interview On the other hand the sheer architectural beauty of these public sanitary places I was amazed at how much toilets can be part of everyday culture not just an almost embarrassing necessity\n","There is undoubtably something unique about Japans toilet culture Public toilets in Tokyo are ubiquitous The city has 53 public WCs per 100000 residents\n","Berlin which recently doubled the number of available facilities still has just 115 per 100000 people\n","Even the most humble public facilities in Japanese gas stations or fast food restaurants are a wonder of fastidious hygiene The country is the world leader in toilet hightech with washlets typically including heated seats builtin bidets with jets to wash and dry users bottoms automated flushing and often a choice of music to mask toilet noises\n","Toto the countrys leading toilet manufacturer and a partner in the Tokyo Toilet Project has its own museum dedicated to the history of the ceramic flush toilet \n","For Wenders Tokyos toilets express something unique and deeply admirable about Japanese culture A drama about a Berlin toilet cleaner one imagines would be a grim affair But Perfect Days is actually closer to a Zen meditation on the pleasures of the simple life\n","Hirayama is like a modernday monk his daily rituals a form of spiritual meditation Every day he eats his lunch on the same bench in a temple garden and takes a photograph with an analog camera of the same patch of light through the treetops\n","In an interview Yakusho Kaji has said the film cowritten by Wenders and Japanese screenwriter Takuma Takasaki is based on the Japanese concept of komorebi a word which describes the play of light and shadow through the leaves of a tree where every shimmering moment is precious and unique\n","The depiction is idealized but it isnt naive There is conflict When Hirayamas carefullybalanced routine is disrupted at one point he is forced to do a double shift to cover for another cleaner who quit without warning  he loses his cool in a rare angry outburst\n","A short scene with his estranged sister hints at a childhood trauma Hirayama is trying to escape\n","Perfect Days is not some panglossian new age pap but a tender contemplation of the rewards and regrets of a flawed life is there any other kind lived in a conscious and considered manner \n","It has certainly won over audiences Perfect Days premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Yakusho Koji took the award for best actor Japan picked the film as its official entry for the 2024 Oscars in the best international feature category a rare honor for a nonJapanese director \n","The Tokyo Toilet Project has been similarly successful\n","According to a survey by the Nippon Foundation satisfaction among users of the 17 redesigned facilities has shot up from 44 to nearly 90 and the number of people with negative views of public toilets shrank from 30 to just 3\n","People who previously didnt give much thought to public toilets have started to take an interest in the facilities said Nippon Foundation Executive Director Sasakawa Junpei Thanks in part to Perfect Days the toilets are becoming tourist attractions in their own right\n","Edited by Elizabeth Grenier\n","\n","\n","'*** From Bach to Brazil with mandolinist Avi Avital 19.12.2023 ****'\n","\n","If youve ever listened to bluegrass youre probably familiar with the mandolin That it can also be found today on the classical concert stage is largely thanks to one contemporary artist Avi Avital He joined forces with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider at the 2023 Beethoven Festival in Bonn to present old new and genreblending works that spanned different cultures and time periods The program included everything from Bach fugues to Balkan rhythms to AfroBrazilian gods and goddesses\n","Mandolinist Avi Avital was born in Israel in 1978 He began playing the mandolin at age eight and went on to study the instrument in Jerusalem and Padua Italy In 2010 he became the first mandolin player ever to be nominated for a Grammy\n","A member of the lute family the mandolin was originally a common folk music instrument It made its way around the world over centuries but its thanks to Avitals expressive and virtuosic playing that it recently exploded onto the classical and new music scenes\n","The mandolin was seen as an amateur instrument throughout music history so the great composers  never bothered to write for the mandolin We dont have a mandolin piece by Bach Brahms Schubert Avital explains I dont feel this is justified and so I think one of my life missions is to change the course of the repertoire of the mandolin and to insert it into the canonic repertoire of classical music by going to living composers and pursue them to write for me to write for the mandolin\n","Avital has commissioned more than 100 works over the past years as a way to cement the mandolin in the classical new music scene\n","One such brandnew piece of music is the prelude for solo mandolin by the contemporary Italian composer Giovanni Sollima he composed the work specifically for Avital Sollima drew on Italian dances like the tarantella and the pizzica which is from Apulia in southern Italy The region has a festival dedicated exclusively to this style of music\n","Similarly to Avital the members of the string quartet Brooklyn Rider Johnny Gandelsman and Colin Jacobsen violin Nicholas Cords viola Michael Nicolas cello perform both old and new music which they believe are complementary\n","One of the ideals youre going for in music is to have a feeling when approaching old music that it is fresh and you are seeing always new things But then when you got a brandnew piece of music you have to very quickly behave as if its your oldest friend in the world and that it feels not foreign but familiar says violist Nicolas Cords\n","Brooklyn Rider violinist Colin Jacobsen is also a composer and one of his compositions Time and Again which he wrote in 2022 for string quartet and mandolin was featured on the Beethoven Festival program\n","My piece was very much conceived with Avi in mind he says explaining that it includes Balkan rhythms yet still maintains classical elements For those who are keeping score in form it is also in a very classical sonataish form those of you who are listening for that youll hear it\n","The other pieces on the program also spanned cultures and geography One was Obrigado which means thank you in Portuguese It was written by the contemporary BrazilianAmerican composer singer and pianist Clarice Assad and pays tribute to the various AfroBrazilian gods by using musical traditions of the AfroBrazilian religion called Umbanda\n","Another work Entracte is by the contemporary American Pulitzer Prizewinning composer Caroline Shaw who took inspiration from a Haydn quartet \n","But the old was not forgotten among the new with arrangements of Bach fugues for string quartet and mandolin and even a Bach chaconne arranged for mandolin making appearances in the program\n","No matter what repertoire hes playing mandolinist Avital feels deeply connected to the instrument in a physical way This instrument has soul he says It just reacts to me where its part of my body\n","We hope you enjoyed the works in todays show which was hosted by Cristina Burack Thanks to sound engineer Thomas Schmidt and producer Gaby Reucher and thanks to all of you for listening If

worldwide fame 19.12.2023 ****'\n","Ever heard of a Ruchermann  or in its diminutive form the Ruchermnnchen The smoking man is a wooden figurine that serves as an incense burner Its just one of the many traditional Christmas decorations from the Erzgebirge or Ore Mountains a Saxony border region renowned for folk art in the form of wooden angels Christmas pyramids and candle arches known as Schwibbogen\n","But the fact that no one ever came up with a proper English translation for the little smoking man suggests it isnt yet one of the regions famous international exports   unlike its direct cousin another wooden figure traditionally made in the Ore Mountains the nutcracker\n","A GermanFrenchRussianAmerican story\n","The nutcracker gained international recognition thanks to its various cultural representations and the fact that authors from different countries borrowed from the original tale International copyright agreements didnt exist when an initial version of the little toy figures story was written by German Romantic author E T A Hoffmann in 1816 titled The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\n","It was adapted by French writer Alexandre Dumas in 1844 The plot of Histoire dun cassenoisette simply called the The Nutcracker in English was nearly identical  but the French version wasnt nearly as dark as the German one\n","In any case Dumas adaptation served as the basis for the 1892 Russian ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov with music composed by Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky\n","The first complete performance of the ballet only reached England in 1934 and it was staged for the first time in the US during the Christmas of 1944 by the San Francisco Ballet company\n","It was such a hit there that it has been staged during the holiday season ever since With hundreds of productions every year the ballet is now a firmly entrenched Christmas ritual for thousands of families in the US  and throughout the world  \n","Friedrich Wilhelm Fchtner the Ore Mountain carver who came up with the first mass produced model of a nutcracker in 1870 obviously didnt know that the character would one day become the star of an international ballet classic He actually had another version of the story in mind when he created his figurine one written by the creator of Der Struwwelpeter Shaggy Peter Heinrich Hoffmann in 1851\n","The German figurine found its way into homes around the world much later One woodcarving company from the Ore Mountains Steinbach had to relocate to Hanover after World War II where many American soldiers were stationed nearby The soldiers started to bring back nutcracker dolls for their families as typical souvenirs from Germany\n","The collectible figures continue to attract visitors to the eastern German region renowned for its wooden folk art\n","Along with the areas different workshops the Nussknackermuseum in Neuhausen the first nutcracker museum in Europe is another recommended stop It not only retains the record for the largest nutcracker collection in the world it also hosts different events throughout the year beyond its exhibition such as an annual nutcracker collectors convention\n","Asked why the nutcracker became so closely associated with Christmas the museums owner Uwe Lschner provided a downtoearth explanation thats typical of the pragmatism of the people of the region During Christmas time poor people used their nuts when they would bake their traditional Stollen fruit bread and cookies and nutcrackers were used to crack those nuts he told DW\n","The nutcracker is more than a just a goodlooking tool Its symbolism continues to be shared across generations and countries thanks to the fairy tale that contributed to its international fame  a universal story of hope and of triumph of good over evil \n","This article was first published in 2021\n","\n","\n","(\"*** 'The Monk and the Gun': Why Bhutan's Oscar entry 'unties a knot' \"\n"," '19.12.2023 ****')\n","Filmmaker Pawo Choyning Dorjis family originally comes from the eastern part of Bhutan where if a child asks a parent to tell them a story they ask them to untie a knot\n","Dorjis latest film The Monk and the Gun is his way of untying the knot that was his homelands social political and cultural transition in the mid2000s \n","I was growing up during this period and The Monk and the Gun is a story about the change and transition that Bhutan went through in the 2000s when we became the last country in the world to allow television to allow the internet and to allow democracy to come in Dorji said \n","But as a Bhutanese living in India where his father was a diplomat and returning to his homeland for school holidays he had a unique perspective on the changes that were engulfing the Himalayan kingdom  \n","In Bhutan we have a saying that you cannot see your eyelashes because they are so close to you For me that was the situation A lot of Bhutanese at that time could not see the changes and the impact of that transition because it was so close to them Dorji told DW in Thimphu Bhutans capital \n","But for me as a Bhutanese living abroad I could see how our society and culture was changing  and I always thought this would make an amazing story to share with the world Its a story of where we as Bhutanese came from and where we are going \n","The film is set in 2006 as Bhutan shifts to a democracy and the government organizes mock elections to teach the people how to vote In a connected plotline an American collector of antique weapons arrives in search of a legendary rifle that falls into the hands of a monk \n","The story is political satire and gentle comedy with elements of suspense combined with touching scenes Dorji says with audiences in different parts of the world responding to different elements \n","When the film received its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado on September 1 audiences laughed at the political satire while viewers in South Korea responded to the story of family Dorji added \n","But the response in his homeland was the most powerful he admits \n","When the film went to Bhutan it was really beautiful because I had a cinema where all the audience was crying and becoming emotional because they connected in a very personal intimate way in the loss of innocence because they lived through that period of change and transition \n","The Monk and the Gun is Bhutans submission to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the 96th Academy Awards for the Best International Feature Film A total of 89 titles are on the initial list with the academy to announce the 15film shortlist on December 21 The official nominations will be unveiled on January 23 2024 ahead of the March 10 Oscars ceremony\n","Variety magazine has ranked The Monk and the Gun as a toptier possibility for the award \n","Bhutan has only previously submitted two films for consideration for an Oscar The Cup in 1999 by Dorjis filmmaking mentor and spiritual teacher Khyentse Norbu and Dorjis own directorial debut Lunana A Yak in the Classroom in 2021  \n","Lunana  the heartwarming tale of a teacher posted to the most remote village in Bhutan  made history when it became the first Bhutanese film to be nominated for an Oscar \n","Lunana is a story about finding home where you belong he said It is a very diverse film it is of a culture that many people do not know of it is set in a country that many people do not know of it is in a language that many people have never heard of When I submitted it to the Oscars they did not even recognize Dzongkha my national language The country of Bhutan was not even on the Oscars list \n","After winning stunning reviews and multiple film awards around the world Dorji received the Heart Son of the Thunder Dragon Bhutans highest civilian award from King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck\n","Critical and commercial success enabled Dorji to focus on his second film and the challenges of a poor developing country in the 21st century \n","Yes the movie focuses on the transition to democracy in Bhutan but it is more about modernization Dorji said of The Monk and the Gun What interests me is how Bhutanese culture reacts to that change \n","The gun in the movie represents the arrival of modernization A gun is something Western and modern and yes if you use it in the right way it can be very beneficial But it is also very dangerous\n","Dorji instructed his actors to be bemused by the weapon to hold it upside down look down the barrel because he wanted to portray their innocence in the face of change And the gun is counterpointed by a large wooden phallus a traditional symbol in Bhutan that the film used to portray tradition culture and innocence \n","Dorji insists he has not thought about winning the Oscar in Los Angeles next year but is focused on sharing Bhutans culture with the rest of the world \n","We are a culture that is based on the Buddhas teaching of love compassion wisdom and kindness and I want to use films to share that with the rest of the world he said But I also want to make films based on these values to keep our traditions relevant and alive for local Bhutanese  \n","Edited by Elizabeth Grenier\n","\n","\n","'*** Remembering Lars Vogt at the 2023 Heimbach Festival 18.12.2023 ****'\n","\n","Imagine you had to program a concert  but not just any concert Your very last concert ever What music would you choose Pianist Lars Vogt chose Brahms Piano Quartet in C minor\n","In summer 2022 Vogt was dying of cancer and he and his loved ones knew he didnt have long In September that year his death unleashed profound grief at the Heimbach Spannungen tensions music festival which he had founded some 25 years prior He had also served as its artistic director performed as a pianist there and conducted many of the ensembles\n","Vogt was in his late 20s when he launched the festival and he wanted to create a musical experience that contrasted with the typical philharmonic hall operation He envisioned a place of retreat a festival with a family feel where the highest quality chamber music is performed in innovative thoughtful and intimate ways\n","And he achieved this The festival kicked off in 1998 and soon became a meeting place for Germanys best chamber musicians Its fame grew quickly and soon extended beyond Germany to Europe and the rest of the world\n","Today the Heimbach music festival is known as the Bayreuth of chamber music with audience members traveling from as far as the US and Japan to attend concerts\n","Heimbach is a quiet town in the hilly Eifel region of western Germany right on the border to Belgium and the festival is set in the towns striking hydroelectric plant from the early 20th century Built in the Jugendstil or art nouveau style its replete with graceful curves and elegant geometry It also has incredible acoustics\n","Vogts passing left a profound hole in the festival but also renewed a sense of purpose among the artists the loyal audience the festival helpers and the sponsors to carry on the unique spirit of the festival that Vogt had poured his soul into\n","There is something very very special about this festival says Tanja Tetzlaff a cellist who has long been involved in the festival and helped organize the 2023 edition which was dedicated to Vogt Its not about showing off or appearances about fame or standing in the spotlight its really just about the music and the friendships and the relationship with the audience Im quite optimistic about what comes next because Heimbach is already such an institution in Germany and internationally That wont change quickly\n","Vogt was proud of his festival especially of how it combined wellknown pieces and historic works with musical rarities and contemporary compositions Vogt shared his opinion in an interview some three years ago\n","I think weve built a certain brand to use a modern term But it can be described in a nicer way  weve built trust When people attend a concert here theyll see two maybe three composers on the program that they havent heard of And maybe also new music But they trust the artists and know that whatever they do will make sense and theyre open to it Thats the way it should be We should be broadening peoples perspectives And I hope it stays this way\n","The 2023 festival did just that with its innovative program of contemporary music classics reimagined and even brandnew works\n","Ten contemporary composers wrote new compositions for the festival edition including the Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth Her piece was entitled In Memoriam Lars and featured Tanja Tetzlaff on violin\n","Another unique work was the final piece on the festivals opening concert a chamber music arrangement of Beethovens sixth symphony the Pastoral symphony There was no conductor no large orchestra  just a string sextet led by first violinist Antje Weithaas It was grand orchestral repertoire reduced to minimal instrumentation to its essentials one could even say and it certainly let the audience hear the work in a new way\n","We hope you enjoyed the works in todays show which

Nazialigned government\n","Holding the machine gun at the top of the 45meterhigh 147foot structure is a victorious Soviet soldier flanked by a mother and child and a worker Further down the plinth is decorated with reliefs featuring World War II battle scenes\n","One of several such monuments across Bulgaria and one of over 4000 across Europe it has dominated the Sofia skyline ever since as a symbol not just of victory over fascism but also of what would become 45 years of hardline communist rule as Bulgaria was absorbed into the Soviet bloc\n","When the USSR collapsed in 1989 the local council voted to have it removed but successive governments have shied away from actually going through with it often under pressure from the Russian embassy and proRussian elements of society\n","Nowadays Bulgaria is a member both of the European Union and NATO and a recent poll showed that the majority of Sofia residents would like to see the monument removed and put in a museum or even demolished\n","The park surrounding the monument has become a gathering place for young people and alternative subcultures and it has often been painted by artists in different colors  most recently in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine\n","This propaganda tool from bygone days must disappear from the city center 19yearold economics student Daniel Roussev told AFP news agency\n","The newlyelected mayor of Sofia Vassil Terziev made dismantling the monument one of his key election promises\n","Officially authorities have said they are taking the monument down because it has become structurally unsafe but local councilor Marta Georgieva said jubilantly It is a longawaited event\n","\n","Nevertheless one third of Sofians are opposed to its removal and the socialists and other proMoscow groups in parliament would like to organize a referendum on its fate\n","On Tuesday Bulgarian Socialist Party BSP leader Kornelia Ninova commented Every monument is a piece of history and we erase a piece of history every time we remove a monument \n","A heavy police presence was dispatched to the area around the monument to prevent possible clashes\n","This monument has a rightful place as it illustrates our history and the art of the time Vessela Naidenova a 38yearold researcher told AFP She came to protest against the dismantling\n","Russia has strongly criticized the dismantling\n","We consider the destruction of the monument to our common past as another hostile step by official Sofia which aggravates the already deadlocked situation in bilateral relations Bulgaria once again chooses the wrong side of history Maria Zakharova spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said\n","According to Bulgarian media she added The barbaric actions of the Bulgarian side have no justification and forgiveness\n","Originally slated to take at least a month to dismantle authorities hope that the work could be finished by Christmas after which the figures  arm

the traditional bow 11.12.2023 ****'\n","To the Japanese the bow is something they do every day Children bow to their teacher and say ohayou gozaimasu or good morning at the start of every school day It would be unthinkable for a business meeting to commence without formal bows\n","Shop staff and train conductors hotel employees janitors and deliverymen all bow to their customers Even passing a colleague in a corridor will inevitably elicit eye contact and a deep nod\n","Its a greeting and its polite But a bow to a Japanese person imparts much more information with each variety having a nuance that communicates a slightly different meaning\n","Bowing is a key part of greetings in Japan said Kiyomoto Ogasawara the heir to the 32nd headmastership of the Ogasawararyu school of reiho or etiquette\n","Bowing signifies trust and peace by showing vulnerability as we avert our eyes and expose the head explained Ogasawara whose family has served as instructors to generations of shoguns since the school was established more than 830 years ago\n","Alongside reiho Ogasawararyu masters teach the disciplines of archery and mounted archery an important military skill as well as a religious ritual at Shinto shrines since ancient times\n","\n","And while etiquette and archery may not appear to be compatible skills Ogasawara said incorporating proper etiquette into a persons daily life is required to attain the strong legs and perfect posture needed to have both hands free to fire a bow from a galloping horse\n","And thats why historically warriors and the elite in society were taught that posture and etiquette are of such importance\n","Its widely believed that bowing became the accepted greeting as far back as the Asuka period between 593 AD and 710 AD Buddhism was arriving in Japan from mainland Asia and there were shifts in the nascent nations artistic social and political mores\n","In the Buddhist faith bowing was  and remains  an important gesture of respect and piety and it was soon adopted to indicate similar reverence for the elite in Japans strictly hierarchical society\n","And while the samurai no longer rule Japan the bow has endured as the mark of respect And failing to perform an adequate bow can still be perceived as a slight particularly among older more traditional Japanese\n","Today the bow is the timehonored greeting in Japan but its also used to communicate farewell the start or end of a class meeting or ceremony and to express gratitude The bow is also used as an apology to accompany a request or show sympathy or appreciation It is deployed when a person is worshipping or at the outset of formal ceremony and is a critical element of martial arts\n","There are three main types of bow in the Japanese business world but each starts from the same position straight back legs straight and firmly planted to avoid slouching The bow should then be performed in time with ones breathing\n","Bending forward from the waist should take one inhalation of breath That position is then sustained for the time it takes to exhale and then the person performing the bow inhales again as he or she returns to an upright position\n","The eshaku bow is a relatively casual greeting exchanged between people of the same status or when formalities are not as important and only requires leaning forward to an angle of 15 degrees for a few seconds\n","Japans national sport can now be enjoyed along with a meal The Yokozuna Tonkatsu Dosukoi Tanaka restaurant opened its doors in Tokyo in 2022 as a place for former sumo wrestlers to demonstrate the traditional art The concept has been met with great enthusiasm from diners\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","The keirei bow is the most common variant in the Japanese business world and requires the person to lean at an angle of 30 degrees and look at the ground about 1 meter about 3 feet in front of their toes\n","A keirei bow is used to greet clients join a meeting or during interactions with superiors\n","The saikeirei indicates the greatest respect to the recipient and requires a bow from the waist of as much as 70 degrees and sustained for several seconds to emphasize respect and sincerity The saikeirei is deployed to greet a very important person such as a member of the imperial family to express deep regret or ask for a significant favor\n","Men performing these bows are expected to keep their arms rigid alongside their legs while women often place one hand atop the other in front of the abdomen\n","Bows performed in the seated position are known as zarei and usually take place on traditional tatami mat floors during traditional occasions such as the tea ceremony or martial arts tournaments\n","All seated bows start from the seiza seated posture with the legs tucked directly below and with the toes pointing straight behind The person sits on their calves with the elbows pointed slightly out and with the palms of the hands on the top of the thighs\n","This position can be uncomfortable for nonJapanese especially if it has to be sustained for a long time but Japanese will appreciate good posture\n","The saikeirei bow starts at the seiza position and requires the person to lean forward until their chest is on their lap Simultaneously the hands slide forward along the thighs until they are on the tatami floor in front of the knees\n","The final position will see the persons face around 5 centimeters 2 inches from the floor and the palms of the hands making a triangle on the floor\n","The futsurei is a less formal variety of the same bow and only requires the person to dip their body until their head is around 30 centimeters from the floor The senrei is even more relaxed and only requires the person to bow about 30 degrees from the waist and have the tips of their fingers on the tatami\n","Another far more rare bow is the dogeza which requires the person to get on their hands and knees and place their face on the ground  and was in the past used when a person was begging for their life after somehow offending a powerful superior\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Matthew Strecher a professor of Japanese literature at Sophia University in Tokyo was given lessons in etiquette when he first arrived in Japan in the 1980s Emphasis was placed on a proper bow and not just ducking my head briefly he said\n","Some latitude is given to foreign people when they try to bow and I think Japanese are even quite amused as they watch us try to get it right but I do think they appreciate the effort he said In the same way they do not appreciate it when we flout expectations and make no effort at what is quite a special moment\n","After more than three decades in Japan Strecher said he knows when a less formal nod to a colleague in passing is adequate and occasions when a greater expression of gratitude or respect is required\n","If I am saying goodbye then it is important to bow properly because failing to do that would not be appreciated and in a business setting we are expected to do the right thing because it is about ensuring the harmony of the workplace he added\n","Kiyomoto Ogasawara said younger generations of Japanese do not grasp the exact meaning of Japans most important form of unspoken communication\n","Actually the subtle meanings of different bows are less known nowadays even in Japan he admitted While they were traditionally learned in the home I believe that anyone can grasp these nuances with some studying he told DW\n","Bowing reflects our cultural identity so it is vital for understanding our roots and sharing them with others he added\n","It is part of our culture influenced by many factors such as our history and environment Recognizing and using different forms of bowing is very valuable\n","Edited by Srinivas Mazumdaru\n","\n","\n","'*** A Rubens painting keeps the courts busy 10.12.2023 ****'\n","Tarquinius and Lucretia is the subject of long GermanRussian disputes The painting by Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens 15771640 disappeared from Germany after World War II Around 20 years ago it was discovered in Russia  in the possession of art dealer Vladimir Logvinenko\n","The story didnt end there Logvinenko tried to have his ownership rights recognized in Germany  unsuccessfully This attempt at clarification could well have been motivated by a desire to sell the painting which is estimated to be worth tens of millions of euros As long as it is listed in all loss registers however such a request is impossible\n","The judiciary has been dealing with the conundrum for over 20 years\n","The Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation BerlinBrandenburg Stiftung Preussische Schlsser und Grten SPSG and the Russian citizen Vladimir Logvinenko are still fighting over the painting\n","The German side claims that the painting was taken to the Soviet Union in the course of looting According to the SPSG the painting Tarquinius and Lucretia by Peter Paul Rubens painted around 1610 or 1611 was part of the collection in the Picture Gallery in Potsdams Sanssouci Park before it was removed due to the war Like the other paintings in the gallery it was moved to the Rheinsberg Palace in 1942 to protect it from war damage\n","According to Russian accounts the painting hung in the bedroom of a house in which a Soviet officer was residing in 1945 After the officer was transferred he is said to have taken all the contents of the house including the Rubens\n","Finally the dealer Logvinenko acquired the painting in 1999 and had it restored The Potsdam public prosecutors office investigated but discontinued proceedings in 2006 because initial suspicion of a criminal offense had not been confirmed The case concerned gang theft\n","The Rubens painting has been a thorny issue in terms of GermanRussian relations Even the heads of state got involved Hannes Hartung a Munichbased lawyer specializing in international art law wrote in his dissertation on Art theft in war and persecution that after the intervention of the two heads of state Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schrder in September 2003 and the confiscation at the request of the Federal Republic of Germany it had long looked as if a positive precedent could be established through the restitution of an important exhibit It seemed like the painting could be returned to Germany\n","However the Russian Federations willingness to cooperate subsequently waned because the current owner insisted that he had acquired the painting in good faith and the Federal Republic of Germany was also unable to provide complete proof of ownership status and the exact circumstances of a warrelated relocation according to Hartungs explanation\n","Nevertheless Logvinenko is not the owner according to the court ruling\n","In 2021 Logvinenko then appealed to the Potsdam Regional Court to have his ownership rights to the painting recognized In November 2023 the court ruled The plaintiff is not the owner of the painting\n","When asked by DW the Potsdam court explained that the legal dispute was subject to Russian law as the painting was indisputably located in Russia at the time of Logvinenkos acquisition The fact that the court was nevertheless able to reach its verdict is due to a legal opinion that was obtained According to this the court can now take the view that the plaintiff is not the owner of the painting under the relevant Russian law because he did not acquire ownership either through a legal transaction or through acquisition in good faith and did not inherit it\n","\n","The current court decision from Potsdam does not mean that the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation BerlinBrandenburg is the owner nor does it mean that the entrepreneur from Russia must return the painting The foundation told DW A return was not the subject of the previous proceedings Further steps are currently being examined\n","According to the SPSG the Rubens painting had been considered lost since the end of the war It is one of the most serious wartime losses of our foundation and was longwanted by Interpol\n","The foundation has no information about where the painting is currently being kept It was last in the possession of a Russian citizen Editors note this refers to Vladimir Logvinenko who wanted to go to court to establish that he was the owner The SPSG has opposed this\n","Apparently the Rubens painting is still in the possession of Vladimir Logvinenko The Berlinbased law firm Unger which represents Logvinenko did not respond to an inquiry as to the purpose of the legal clarification regarding the recognition of ownership and why it took place in Germany\n","Hannes Hartung an expert in art law explains Tarquinius and Lucretia is still listed in all lost property registers There is the state database Lost Art There are also private loss databases A painting like this is completely unsaleable for the Russian owner as long as it is being sought as looted art as it is now The ownership status is also highly questionable because it is looted art\n","The lawyer from Munich assumes that the Russian investor has been advised to file a lawsuit Many people hope that they can plead acquisitive prescription ie that the painting was seized in good faith and they therefore became the owner says Hartung\n","The currently rejected complaint by the Russian citizen can really only mean one thing The plaintiff wants to sell the Rubens abroad He needs a kind of clean bill of health but he wont get one from the SPSG explains expert Hannes Hartung who once represented the art collector Cornelius Gurlitt under civil law\n","The Gurlitt case goes back to a large art find that raised the question of whether Nazilooted art was among the inherited artworks\n","Logvinenko has to bear the costs of the Potsdam proceedings as the plaintiff He can still appeal Hartung believes that the art dealer may have speculated He thought that he would be able to sell the painting on for a large profit at some point Thats not possible with looted art\n","Twenty years ago it was still hoped that an agreement could be reached and that Tarquinius and Lucretia would be returned to Germany And now The GermanRussian looted art debate is frozen We had a very open relationship around 2006 2007 Since the war in Ukraine the door has been closed and there are no talks between Germany and the Russian Federation summarizes Hartung\n","The ambiguity over its ownership remains and the stalemate may well go on for another 20 years\n","This article was translated from German\n","\n","\n","\"*** 'Maestro' pays tribute to Leonard Bernstein 06.12.2023

Freiheit freedom instead of Freude joy in the final chorus He once spontaneously took his student the Japanese conductor Kent Nagano to an art exhibition instead of holding a conducting lesson\n","For the charismatic and outgoing Bernstein life was a dance  quite literally so especially when he was conducting\n","Now Leonard Bernsteins exceptional personality shines through in Bradley Coopers new film Maestro \n","Along with Bernsteins musical successes Cooper primarily focuses on the maestros personal life addressing how his relationship with his wife Costa Ricaborn Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre played by Carey Mulligan was strained by his homosexuality\n","Just like in his criticallyacclaimed directorial debut A Star is Born Cooper stars in the lead role embodying the protagonist in different phases of his life \n","In September Maestro had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival The film is now released in cinemas and will also be coming out on Netflix on December 20 \n","While the biopic has already garnered positive reviews it also caused a stir ahead of its release\n","The trailer showing that Bradley Cooper wore a prosthetic nose to depict the Jewish conductor stoked accusations of antisemitism\n","Historically antisemitic caricatures have depicted Jewish people as having exaggerated hooked noses a stereotype that has been used to justify the marginalization of Jews\n","Some critics also questioned why a nonJewish actor should be cast in the role of a Jew comparing it to Blackfacing the formerly widespread and racist practice of nonBlack performers using makeup to caricature Black people \n","However Bernsteins children didnt feel the nose was a problem His 71yearold daughter Jamie Bernstein described the controversy as ridiculous and said that her father actually did have a nice big nose\n","Leonard Bernstein was born on August 25 1918 to Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the United States \n","In addition to music he also

\n","The film also portrays how Bernstein had his breakthrough as a conductor in 1943 when he stepped in at the last minute to conduct the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall in replacement of Bruno Walter who had fallen ill The critics were full of praise Bernstein later became the orchestras music director \n","As a composer Leonard Bernstein was influenced by jazz and AfricanAmerican rhythms of the 1940s He was also interested in Jewish music and sounds from his ancestors Ukrainian homeland He was a great musical composer\n","His name will forever be associated with his bestknown stage work West Side Story from 1957 A first film adaptation by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise came out in 1961 Steven Spielberg also directed his film version of the story in 2021 \n","Bernstein was not only a conductor and composer but also a humanist and teacher In the 1970s he explained basic concepts of classical music on television in the Young Peoples Concerts series and introduced composers in a humorous way\n","Many of the worlds great conductors such as Herbert Blomstedt Kent Nagano and Seiji Ozawa started out as Bernsteins assistants \n","The film Maestro is primarily set during the 25 years of Leonard Bernsteins marriage with his wife Felicia who had found out that Bernstein was homosexual shortly after their wedding in 1951\n","To the outside world the couple initially had an exemplary marriage with three children but both had extramarital affairs \n","In 1976 Bernstein left his wife But when he learned a year later that she had lung cancer he stayed by her side until her death in 1978\n","Maestro shows how Bernstein was conflicted by the different aspects of his life he is portrayed as a man who remained a constant seeker and who charmed audiences

were part of his bringing this work of art to life Jamie Bernstein told the press at the Venice Film Festival It was touching to us his desire to tell this story as authentically as he could\n","The

greatest diva ever 02.12.2023 ****'\n","A century ago on December 2 1923 a daughter was born to the Kalogeropoulou family Greek immigrants who had settled in Manhattan The baby girl was named Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia\n","As Maria Callas she would launch a stage career just 17 years later and become arguably the greatest opera diva of all time within the next decade\n","Today in the centenary year of her birth Maria Callas is more present than ever\n","To mark the event the world is celebrating Callas Large and small opera houses are hosting gala evenings devoted to her publishers are presenting dozens of new publications and record labels are digging out their archival treasures\n","Performance artist Marina Abramovic pays tribute to the diva in her latest work 7 Deaths of Maria Callas which explores the skillful way Callas performed her stage heroines deaths\n","In his upcoming biopic Maria Chilean director Pablo Larrain reconstructs the real last days of the lonely stars life shortly before her death in Paris in 1977 at the age of just 53 Larrain has cast Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to play the title role\n","The film isnt set for release until 2024\n","But just in time for her centenary a Callas Museum will be opening in Athens whose conservatory accepted the musical prodigy as a student when she was just 14\n","UNESCO included the centenary of Maria Callas birth in its list of anniversaries as her audio legacy is undoubtedly part of intangible World Heritage\n","And finally in the summer of 2023 a 2 coin featuring an iconic Callas portrait came into circulation\n","Why is Maria Callas the only singer of a past era who is still present not only in music but in theater film fine arts and even gossip columns Thats the question posed by Eva Gesine Baur author of a carefully researched biography of the diva published in German earlier this year What allowed her to become unique\n","Bauer isnt the first to ask those questions Many have attempted to explain the Callas phenomenon over the years\n","In 1958 Italian music critic and journalist Teodoro Celli got to the heart of at least one aspect when he wrote that in Callas singing instinct and temperament merge in an unparalleled art of performance\n","As early as 1953 director Franco Zeffirelli who experienced Callas as Medea at La Scala described her impact as opera BC and opera AC  before Callas and after Callas\n","In her fewer than 30 years on stage the indefatigable soprano performed 47 roles revolutionizing the art of opera in the process\n","Three of them are particularly well known Donizettis Lucia di Lammermoor Puccinis Tosca and of course Norma  which Callas believed Bellini had written for her despite the fact that she was not even born until almost a century after his death\n","Callas saw herself primarily as a singing actress Callas biographer Eva Gesine Bauer says that approach allowed her to save opera from a gradual demise into indifference Callas herself was never indifferent to any aspect of her performance not a note not a breath not a gesture not a character trait of the women she portrayed Bauer adds\n","But that explains only part of the divas enduring appeal Curiosity about Maria Callas the woman is at least as great as the interest in her as an artist\n","It would be easy to tell the story of Maria Callas life through infamous anecdotes and scandals especially since they have all been welldocumented in the gossip pages of the world press stormy disagreements with artistic directors bickering with fellow singers in particular with her main rival Renata Tebaldi Callas found comparisons between her and Tebaldi as apt as comparing champagne to CocaCola  where she of course represented the highend sparkling wine\n","Her chronic struggles with her domineering mother were as fascinating to the press as her marriage to wealthy industrialist Giovanni Battista Meneghini who was twice her age Gossip pages reported on her jetset lifestyle cancelled performances angry outbursts and poor eyesight\n","Callas was very nearsighted but was too vain to wear her thick glasses on stage So directors had to find other solutions to help their star soloist find her way around the stage Luchino Visconti who directed her in La traviata in Milan had perfumed handkerchiefs placed on the stage so the singer could use the scent to hit her marks\n","Then there was a long and by todays standards toxic relationship with shipping magnate Aristotle Ari Onassis  whose marriage to presidential widow Jacqueline Kennedy Callas is said to have read about in the press while she was still his partner\n","There was also the midcareer weight loss from more than 90 kilograms to around 60 kilograms within just a few months which some observers have blamed for Callas vocal decline According to legend that weight loss was achieved by consuming tapeworm eggs for breakfast washed down with a glass of champagne In reality she underwent weightreducing hormone therapy the most modern method she could find  highly efficient but at least as bad for her health as the tapeworm would have been\n","Maria Callas died alone in her Paris apartment leaving behind an estate containing some 40 mink coats 250 cashmere sweaters countless handbags and several drawers of fulllength velvet gloves many never worn\n","But does collecting all these anecdotes bring one any closer to understanding why Maria Callas remains such a phenomenon Of course not says biographer Eva Gesine Bauer who adds that all the rumors and legends tend to present Callas as a victim of her overbearing mother of sensationalistic reporters of a faithless lover But Bauer says that gives a skewed picture of this remarkable woman who was never a victim neither on stage or off\n","She exercised selfdetermination in her life just as she did in her singing  decisive and assured down to the most subtle vocal nuance\n","In a way she is the most modern of all women wrote Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini about Callas But inside her lives a woman of antiquity strange mysterious and magical which triggers terrible conflicts within her\n","The wild the imperfect and the broken are what takes Maria Callas from the minutiae of her private life and the times in which she lived and makes her what she was and still is  one of the greatest artists of all time\n","This article was originally published in German\n","\n","\n","(\"*** Female Arab filmmakers' biggest challenge? Western preconceptions \"\n"," '01.12.2023 ****')\n","The mood at this weeks Marrakech International Film Festival may have been slightly subdued Organizers at the 20th edition of the annual festival one of the largest in the Arab world deliberately toned down the red carpet glamour and canceled the usual public screenings in the citys iconic central square partially due to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip as well as the recent earthquake at home\n","But it was also true that the female filmmakers who work in the Middle East and showed their movies at Marrakech had something to celebrate Overall theyre doing very well perhaps even better than their counterparts in Europe and North America when it comes to representation and gender equity\n","It is not just by chance that there are more and more female filmmakers in the region FrenchTunisian director Sonia Ben Slama told DW in Marrakech Its because for a long time these female stories were told by men There was a need to reclaim our voices in cinema\n","Ben Slamas documentary Machtat which screened at Marrakech is a prime example For five years Ben Slama followed a trio of women who work as wedding singers in Tunisia gaining insights into their turbulent private and professional lives\n","But there are also less ephemeral factors making female Arab filmmakers more visible and more successful\n","Streaming platforms like Netflix are spending more on localized content  that is Arabiclanguage content for Arab audiences  supporting women in film financially and logistically as well as offering a wider platform for their work This is happening as the number of subscribers to ondemand streaming services in the Middle East and North Africa grows from around 5 million in 2017 to 21 million in 2022\n","Arabmade films now regularly compete at the worlds biggest film festivals  Cannes Venice Berlin Sundance  and European coproductions are common Additionally many Middle Eastern film festivals and their attendant production platforms now work towards equality In fact many have quotas for femaleled productions\n","In 2019 the Cairo Film Festival became the first Arab film festival to sign an international charter for gender parity at such events The Doha Film Institute in Qatar has regularly awarded almost half of all production grants to women\n","And this week in Marrakech of 25 international production teams selected for mentorship at the Atlas Workshops there were 11 female directors and 12 female producers involved \n","In Morocco Tunisia and Lebanon approximately 25 of all new directors are females In Qatar nearly 60 of emerging filmmakers are women Fatma Hassan alRemaihi head of the Doha Film Institute noted  in a 2019 post for the Wilson Center a Washingtonbased think tank In comparison according to the latest data from Statista only 15 of film directors in the US were women in 2022\n","In fact the highestgrossing Arabic language film ever  the Oscarnominated Capernaum  was directed by a woman Lebanese filmmaker Nadine Labaki \n","But even as all this is happening female Arab filmmakers are facing some unexpected challenges Audiences everywhere whether European or Arab have certain expectations about their work\n","Over the past two decades the most commercially successful Arab films in Europe closely adhered to specific formulas stories of terrorism poverty female oppression Egyptian film critic and festival programmer Joseph Fahim wrote in a 2020 review of Arab cinema for the European Institute of the Mediterranean In other words films that ratify Western viewers perceptions and prejudices of the Arab world rather than defy them \n","During test screenings of Machtat Ben Slama recalls how viewers were quite surprised about the behavior of the women in her documentary I felt they were waiting for the women to be good mothers or victims or to adhere to other stereotypes she explained But they were more complex than that They might not react the way we expect them to And thats important Ben Slama argues because it shows their complexity their humanity\n","And then it doesnt matter whether the story is set in Tunisia or Europe everyone relates the director said\n","Its about making films that have a universal appeal agreed French Moroccan director Sofia Alaoui She presented her debut feature film Animalia at the Marrakech Film Festival this week too The movie is unusual a sciencefiction thriller starring a young pregnant woman and her wealthy family psychedelic aliens stoic countryfolk the stunning Moroccan landscape and a cast of birds dogs and sheep all behaving very badly\n","Actually I never was really inspired by Arab cinema Alaoui continued My favorite films were more Asian or Danish or from Finland So what Im trying to do is bring the cinema that I love but in an Arabic way\n","Alaoui ran into audience preconceptions too Some people criticized the film she said because it was not as focused on the Moroccan scenery or village dwellers as her earlier short films had been It is almost like some audiences particularly those in Europe prefer to see an exotic or almost fetishized version of Arabs on the big screen she argued\n","It can be a problem Tania El Khoury the producer of Ben Slamas film Machtat confirmed Arabdirected films do well in art house cinemas or at festivals but its harder to get wider distribution especially if a director tackles a topic that discomforts Arab audiences and surprises European viewers Then the movie gets stuck she said\n","I have seen female directors criticized by European audiences because they told stories about women that are free independent and different from what the audience excepted from Middle Eastern movie makers El Khoury noted \n","The Moroccan film industry is very dynamic and we want to tell local stories added Moroccan director Asmae El Moudir who also screened her film The Mother of All Lies at Marrakech this week her unique documentary is Moroccos candidate for the Oscars this year and won several prizes at Cannes Many of us are friends But we are also very different people and we have different ways of working That should be accepted\n","Sometimes I think the European industry patronizes us Alaoui said You know heres a film festival heres some diversity from the Middle East here are the same storylines about emancipation I find that so boring But there are so many more of us in the industry now There are so many more options so many directors And the world should accept that we are much more diverse than they think\n","Edited by Elizabeth Grenier\n","\n","\n","'*** NFT bubble has truly burst, but do they have a future? 01.12.2023 ****'\n","Many strange things happened in the global economy during the depths of the COVID19 pandemic but few as curious as the NFT boom of 2021\n","Barely anyone knew what a nonfungible token NFT was at the start of that year By the end of it more than 40 billion 366 billion had been spent on blockchainrecorded digital assets and artwork That made the sector almost as valuable as the global art market itself\n","If 2021 was the boom then 2022 was the bust In January 2022 the market reached its dizzying height but by September of that year trading volumes had fallen by a gigantic 97\n","The NFT crash was part of the wider cryptocurrency sector wipeout which saw an astonishing 2 trillion loss of value\n","So are NFTs simply dead or is there some kind of future for them\n","In early November 2023 OpenSea the largest NFT marketplace announced it was laying off half its workforce Then there was a bizarre event at a promotional event in Hong Kong for the Bored Ape Yacht Club one of the bestknown NFT collections Dozens of people reported severe eye burn after attending the event which featured heavy use of ultraviolet lighting\n","None of that is good news yet there have also been signs recently of a very modest revival in the battered sector with trading volumes edging up recently after falling steadily throughout 2023\n","When the NFT boom took off in the summer of 2021 Andrea Barbon was one of the many people intrigued by the potential of the new innovation\n","He quickly created and sold his own collection a set of computergenerated fractal images\n","This venture sparked in me a profound curiosity and the willingness to delve deeper into NFTs Barbon a finance professor at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland  and the HSG Center for Financial Services Innovation told DW\n","My fascination with the blend of art technology and finance that NFTs represent motivated me to study them in extensive detail exploring their potential impact on various sectors and their role in the future of digital ownership and creativity\n","From the start many were dismissive of NFTs Bill Gates famously said they were 100 based on the greater fool theory  the idea that one can make money through the purchase of overvalued fundamentally worthless assets  as long as there is a greater fool who will come along and pay even more\n","Obviously expensive digital images of monkeys are going to improve the world immensely Gates joked in an apparent reference to the Bored Ape collection\n","Yet NFTs took off Perhaps the unique circumstances of the time when the pandemic meant people around the world were spending unusual amounts of time online and at home played a part\n","Barbon says the cryptocurrency boom in full flow in 2021 fueled excitement in NFTs while userfriendly platforms such as OpenSea made it very easy for people to buy and trade them\n","Then there was the exclusivity factor cultivated by celebrity purchases and the creation of NFT clubs\n","The allure of NFTs was further amplified by their novelty the promise of high returns and their role as status symbols within the crypto community Barbon said This combination of technological innovation market dynamics and cultural factors created a perfect storm that propelled the NFT boom\n","For Barbon and his colleague Angelo Ranaldo at the Swiss Finance Institute NFTs represented a fascinating field of study As part of their academic research they examined more than 15 million NFT transactions worth around 18 billion between January 2021 and September 2022 They came to the conclusion that the whole market represented a bubble\n","We observed a pronounced tendency for bubblelike behaviors in the NFT market Barbon said This was characterized by rapid price surges often doubling within days or even hours followed by steep declines These fluctuations offered significant returns for investors but also posed substantial risks\n","Something else they noticed was that some investors showed an ability to consistently capitalize on the markets volatility making significant amounts of money while others displayed more reckless behavior\n","The market experienced inflated valuations driven more by speculative fervor than underlying fundamentals he found\n","Some NFTs have had stunning collapses in value The Bored Ape collection for example which became especially popular with celebrities has lost more than 90 of its value amounting to several billion dollars The singer Justin Bieber and the Brazilian footballer Neymar are among those to have spent around 1 million each on Bored Ape NFTs only to see the value all but disappear\n","The fallout from the celebrity NFT craze continues to this day This week footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was hit with a classaction lawsuit seeking at least 1 billion in damages for his role in promoting NFTs issued by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance\n","As a result there is deep underlying skepticism about the market But Barbon says it can still have a future especially if its returns to its origins as a marketplace for digital artists\n","They are not just a technological novelty but a groundbreaking innovation with practical applications he said NFTs have revolutionized the market for digital art providing contemporary artists specializing in digital media a platform to authenticate and monetize their creations\n","He also sees other possible uses for NFTs beyond the art world in realms like digital identity and the ownership of virtual assets\n","Yet the bubble and the huge losses incurred means there will be a big question mark over NFTs

pop art it is a ride through recent art history and shows the complex relationship between art and politics and society Zerreissprobe stands for the radical upheavals post1945 says cocurator Maike Steinkamp\n","And indeed there were plenty of trials and tribulations in the second half of the last century  political and economic social and artistic These include upheavals in civilization such as World War II and the Holocaust the ideological confrontation between East and West during the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain to name just the most dramatic They all kept the world on tenterhooks At the same time they inspired artists gave them cause for reflection and often for redefinition Some broke new ground\n","This becomes particularly clear in the exhibitions Existential Experiences section It shows how artists reacted with deep uncertainty to the horrors of war and the cultural collapse of the Holocaust after 1945 Fear and inner turmoil are reflected in the spindly overlong figures of Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti for example The unfathomable black holes on the gloomy reliefs by US artist Lee Bontecou cry out for orientation as does the surrealism attached to the articulated doll by Dresden artist Wilhelm Lachnit 18991962\n","The political and military division of the world between East and West the struggle between ideologies for sovereignty of interpretation and propaganda provides a completely different test of endurance This can also be seen in the visual arts An artistic battle for direction breaks out between figurative and abstract In Western Europe and the United States younger artists turn to new abstract forms of expression The German artist KO Gtz 19142017 for example throws paint onto the canvas and blurs it with a squeegee to create abstract informal structures The Americans Mark Rothko 19031970 and Morris Louis 19121962 painted large sometimes monochrome color fields\n","In the GDR and other socialist countries on the other hand Socialist Realism was raised to the highest level It was supposed to show the toiling workers and farmers as they were state art as propaganda But there were also GDR artists who defied the political guidelines such as Harald Metzkes or Werner Tbke 19292004 And figurative art also lives on in many studios in the West for example in the paintings and sculptures of Pablo Picasso 18811973

shopping frenzy of Black Friday Week with a campaign aimed at the online retailer Amazon and what one Peng member called its Soviet business model\n","In keeping with Pengs ambition to create an explosive concoction of activism hacking and art the campaign is a fourpronged attack A Black Friday protest outside the Amazon Tower building in Berlin an online petition a satirical Amazonthemed circus created by the Rimini Protokoll theater group and an Amazon Leaks page where the companys employees can report alleged abuses at the company\n","But according to Jean Peters Peng spokesperson investigative journalist and veteran of several Peng stunts the reported working conditions are just a symptom of the basic problem Amazons colossally successful business model\n","This he claims is unique as it relies on monopolizing access to customers forcing small retailers to give up huge percentages to sell on its marketplace and above all exploiting an army of small subcontractors whose employees have only limitedtime contracts and few workers rights\n","There are wellknown issues with subcontractor chains Delivery companies like Amazon Hermes and FedEx use subcontractors who often contract even smaller companies Some of these operations according to Rory Linton spokesman for Germanys second largest trade union Verdi are in fierce competition to undercut each other and are so small that they only employ two or three people and only exist for a short time They know they cant fulfill the contracts if they have correct health and safety and pay a decent wage so the big companies get rid of the responsibility he said\n","Linton describes cases reported to the union where subcontractors did not allow their workers to turn on the Amazon app that records their working hours for the first and last hours of their shift Not only that Amazon stipulates that its Freight Partners in Germany can only operate a maximum of ten trucks which according to Verdi both restricts any chance of competition and ensures that delivery drivers cannot organize effectively\n","With subcontractors there are almost no checks and balances in terms of workers rights health and safety Linton told DW Often workers get less than minimum wage\n","Verdi wants an outright ban on subcontractors in the postal package industry a proposal that has already been echoed by some of Germanys state governments\n","There has been a backlash in the industry Frank Huster head of the logistics industry association DSLV which represents big hauling companies says a ban would only have a disruptive effect on supply chains Any freight forwarder subcontracts transport companies on a regular basis If precarious employment relationships are found at transport companies this must be remedied in the internal relationship between employer and employee and not by a general ban on commissioning transport service providers he told DW\n","A ban would be a very bad idea according to Sebastian Hassler who has spent 20 years running several small and mediumsized logistics firms whose clients include Amazon and other major companies\n","That wont solve the problem he told DW Just because there are a few black sheep who I believe are a minority  to ban the entire industry because of that Thats my livelihood and we pay taxes and social contributions and treat people decently\n","He also thinks banning the contracts like the ones he has with Amazon would only concentrate more power in the larger companies hands as it would force delivery drivers to work directly for the major corporations\n","Hassler says theres plenty to criticize about Amazon Im also critical of the fact that Amazon has this market dominance and its clear that its getting tougher for midsized companies he said And we know that Amazon pays very little tax and I dont agree with that either\n","And yet If I compare the big players Amazon is actually the fairest he added Amazon tells us how much we have to pay our drivers and its way over the minimum wage And we have to prove the number of hours they worked\n","He also says that in his experience Amazon is among the quickest of the big companies to cancel contracts if compliance rules are broken\n","The problem with subcontractors according to industry representatives DW spoke to had more to do with the states failure to catch lawbreaking companies \n","Marten Bosselmann head of the German Parcel and Express Association BIEK argues that there are already plenty of workers rights protection laws in place The big package delivery service providers are not law enforcement authorities he told DW We would like to see more controls and the people who break the rules who dont pay their workers properly they have to be taken out of circulation\n","Activists meanwhile insist that Amazons market dominance and allconsuming business model  funneling retailers and customers through its platform while keeping subcontractors small  suffocates competition\n","Amazon is a kind of microcosm of a radical planned economy to concentrate profits for a few people said Jean Peters of Peng With Amazon we have a planned economy with total surveillance of all the workers and all the products in a way the Soviets could only dream of And all of that is done not for the redistribution of wealth but for profit\n","Amazon rejects all these claims saying that it is in competition with several other major retailers and that its marketplace model actually helps small businesses\n","The fact is that Amazon has created millions of good jobs while supporting hundreds of thousands of small businesses around the world an Amazon spokesperson told DW in a statement We offer our employees good wages and benefits attractive career opportunities and a modern and safe working environment for all\n","Olaf Scholzs government is drawing up a new postal services law that will apparently include a crackdown on subcontractor abuses Nontransparent subsubcontractor relationships and repeated violations of labor and social law requirements give reason to expand the legal instruments the Economy Ministry said

promotes boycotts and economic sanctions against Israel to end international support for Israels oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law BDS was designated antisemitic by the German parliament in 2019 \n","Claudia Roth the German minister of state for culture denounced the BDS letter signed by Hoskote as clearly antisemitic a claim based in part on its calling Israel a settlercolonial apartheid state BDS is modeled on the boycott movement that campaigned against apartheid in South Africa\n","Hoskote has since resigned from the committee and refused to distance himself from the statement he signed  as demanded by documenta managing director Andreas Hoffmann\n","Israeli artist and writer Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger also resigned from the committee after her request for the process to be slowed in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks was rejected\n","Now the rest of the committee  Simon Njami Gong Yan Kathrin Rhomberg and Mara Ines Rodriguez  have announced their collective resignation from this honorable task \n","In a statement released on Friday November 17 the former committee members justified their resignation in light of what they called an emotional and intellectual climate of oversimplification of complex realities in regards to accusations of antisemitism at documenta \n","This related not only to concerns over support for the BDS movement but months of debate about depictions of antisemitic cliches in the works of Ruangrupa the Indonesian curatorial group behind last years documenta festival\n","\n","While the outgoing committee members acknowledged that Germany has distinct social and political responsibilities and that alarming signs of deeprooted antisemitism are once again making themselves felt around the world they feared the issue has been misused for opinion politics\n","In the current circumstances we do not believe that there is a space in Germany for an open exchange of ideas and the development of complex and nuanced artistic approaches that documenta artists and curators deserve stated the resignation letter\n","Culture Minister Roth responded to the resignations on Friday saying that we now need a credible new start for which documenta must also be repositioned with regard to its organizational structures\n","In Rajit Hoskotes resignation letter published on November 13 he wrote that he had publicly spoken out against the intellectual and cultural boycott of Israel He also expressed his wish to restate his highest regard for the Jewish people and his deepest empathy with their historic sufferings and admiration for their glorious cultural achievements\n","But he also claimed that criticism of Israel is not antisemitic\n","I am being asked to accept a sweeping and untenable definition of antisemitism that conflates the Jewish people with the Israeli state and that correspondingly misrepresents any expression of sympathy with the Palestinian people as support for Hamas he continued\n","My conscience does not permit me to accept this sweeping definition and these strictures on human empathy Hoskote wrote\n","In her criticism of the BDS letter signed by Hoskote Roth also questioned the federal governments financial involvement in documenta\n","Subsidies for the international art exhibition in Kassel central Germany will only be provided Roth said if there is a joint plan and visible reform steps These include clear responsibilities and a genuine opportunity for the federal government to participate and set standards to prevent antisemitism and discrimination\n","The federal governments contribution to documenta 15 in 2022 amounted to 35 million 38 million while the two main shareholders  the city of Kassel and the state of

domed and staged lecture hall is a masterpiece of Prussian early classicism and proved irresistible for The Hunger Games scouts\n","Interestingly the 2005 scifi film Aeon Flux starring Charlize Theron

table is decorated with fine dishware wine glasses and candles set as though for a traditional Shabbat meal Family members normally gather here  but the chairs on the square in front of the Tel Aviv

tables Empty Beds is the name of the installation which was set up by the organization Bring Them Home Now in collaboration with art students Together they sang the national anthem Hatikvah whose title means hope \n","Israel is a small country Almost everyone knows someone affected by the massacre in which Hamas terrorists killed 1400 people in Israel on October 7 or someone whose family members are now being held captive somewhere in the Gaza Strip This Is Us is the fitting name of the art project for which the faces of the abducted have been rendered in paint on canvas\n","Its not a place of commemoration the aim is to get awareness about the hostages says Yifat Gurion The art project that she helped initiate is a matter close to her heart and one that she wants to take beyond Israels borders\n","She feels the hostages are being forgotten as the current focus is on the humanitarian situation in Gaza I really feel a deep sorrow for the innocent people of Gaza who are suffering Gurion says But it seems that the world is missing the point that this is not retaliation and should not be retaliation This is an effort to get more than 200 hostages free So this is a very very powerful and very important message that must be repeated\n","Artists from all over Israel and some from abroad took part in the project In front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art they created paintings of the hostages based on photographs\n","Some 150 artists worked in two shifts mornings and afternoons They were highly focused and almost meditative as though they were connecting psychically with their subjects\n","One artist painted someone with the same name as theirs another a person whose birthday it was Speaking to The Times of Israel artist Hodaya Gilad said that the whole time she worked on a portrait of 18yearold Liri Albab she wondered what the young girl was going through  and so felt as if she were getting to know her\n","It wasnt just the artists who felt that way but also passersby There were emotional moments when people recognized friends or family members in the paintings The square in front of the museum was unofficially renamed The Kidnapped and

powerful tool to spread around and to make the project public in the world she says\n","Gurion continues to draw hope that the hostages will be released Right now these times are dark Its very hard to hang on to hope it is hard Its maybe even unnatural she says But we dont have a choice\n","Gurion says she grew up with stories of pioneers who came to Israel from Germany Russia and other countries Not that they had much choice Whoever didnt come to Israel was killed in the Holocaust They came here and I was born and raised in Israel This is where I raise my children These are my friends and

became the German national teams first starting quarterback two years later\n","Today he is the only former professional athlete in Germany to speak publicly about the illness he believes he suffers from  chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE\n","Grau will probably not find out for certain in his lifetime whether he has CTE To date the disease can only be definitively diagnosed after death through a brain autopsy But Grau has been experiencing the symptoms that scientists associate with CTE for over 20 years\n","His memory is getting fuzzier and fuzzier He schedules any conversations with people he doesnt know personally before noon as he can hardly concentrate later in the day\n","I also feel dizzy more and more often he said The MRI shows that my brain is atrophying shrinking in all areas\n","His physical coordination is deteriorating as well he said\n","I know its not going to get any better But Im trying to hold on to what I still have he said\n","At the age of 45 the former secondary school teacher first noticed that he was starting to have trouble concentrating and suddenly becoming quicktempered and aggressive  something that had never been in his nature\n","Studies have shown that ones personality can change dramatically during the earliest stage of the disease The risk of suicide increases and violent outbursts are also possible\n","Australian rules football player Heather Anderson took her own life in November 2022 at the age of 28 Philipp Adams a former cornerback in the National Football League NFL shot six people and then himself in April 2021 The autopsies on the brains of Anderson and Adams found that both had been suffering from CTE\n","Around 350 cases of CTE have been confirmed in former NFL players The disease has also been detected in deceased players in other contact sports such as rugby ice hockey football boxing and martial arts\n","Their brains were significantly reduced in size In addition whole clumps of tau protein were found in the outermost layer of the cerebrum These tiny protein building blocks stabilize the nerve cells When the brain makes sudden movements there is a risk that the proteins will fold incorrectly This can damage the nerve cell to such an extent that it dies This can lead to a chain reaction\n","Like all neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers and Parkinsons CTE is currently incurable Only the symptoms can be treated\n","In the United States as well as Australia and New Zealand countries where Aussie rules football and rugby are particularly popular sports brain banks have been established There donor brains from deceased athletes are collected and studied\n","It would be a dream come true for me if we also had a sports brain bank specializing in CTE in Germany to which my brain could be taken after my death Grau said\n","The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases DZNE is currently setting up a brain bank Researchers here face a shortage of tissue material as Germans tend to be more reluctant about organ donations than people in many other countries\n","Researchers were aware of the clinical profile of CTE as early as the 1920s Back then it was known as dementia pugilistica boxers dementia or simply being punch drunk Even back then it was widely thought that heavy blows to the head could cause lasting damage to the brain Now we know that even repeated minor blows to the head  blows that arent sufficient to cause a concussion  can have serious consequences\n","If you accumulate these head concussions over many years they lead to neurodegenerative processes similar to head trauma Inga Krte professor of neurobiology at LudwigMaximiliansUniversitt in Munich and Harvard Medical School in Boston told DW\n","This has been established by research over the past 10 years in different sports age groups and countries These are robust results\n","But apparently hardly anyone in Germany is interested\n","Krte who has been conducting research on CTE since 2009 visits sports clubs to inform parents about the possible longterm effects of head concussions\n","At one large football soccer club whose name I wont mention only one interested father turned up Krte said Its obviously not yet an issue that parents in elitelevel sports in this country are dealing with\n","Krtes field of research also includes other ailments such as Alzheimers Disease or depression\n","Its about brain health as a whole Can the brain tolerate being constantly shaken The answer is probably no Or maybe some brains can tolerate it but not all of them\n","Erich Grau is convinced that certainly a quarter of his former football teammates are currently experiencing extreme mental decline Despite this they do not talk about the CTE

is anonymity is also considered the creator of some of the most famous works of street art of all time Consider the kissing policemen the anarchist throwing a flower bouquet instead of a Molotov cocktail or the little girl reaching for a red balloon thats floating away\n","Spectacular actions like the selfshredding of an artwork right after it sold at auction for a large sum of money have gained Banksy a reputation as a kind of Robin Hood of the art world a criticallythinking free spirit a prankster\n","Its much easier to see a Banksy work on a poster or on the artists own Instagram account than to glimpse one out in the wild Street art is by definition an ephemeral form of expression\n","To get a picture of this busy artists entire oeuvre you would have to travel almost the entire world Art experts say Banksy has been active in at least 20 countries over the last two decades  and not just in the artists hometown of Bristol or in London but also in hardtoreach corners of the world for example in Bethlehem and on the border with the Gaza Strip where Banksy has been spraypainting since 2015 and has run a hotel near the barrier wall since 2017 Or in the destroyed suburbs of Kyiv using the ruins of war for powerful expressions of solidarity\n","But in some cases you can stay closer to home and simply go to a Banksy exhibition As the artists fame has grown so have the efforts to place Banksy in a museum context One exhibition was even authorized by Banksy  titled Cut  Run which was held in Glasgow last summer and featured mostly the stencils used to create the iconic street art works As Banksy described it While the unauthorized Banksy shows may look like the sweepings from the floor of my studio Cut  Run actually is the sweepings from the floor of my studio\n","Following this logic visitors to the unauthorized show entitled The Mystery of Banksy A Genius Mind are not getting to see the actual studio sweepings But thats done nothing to diminish the popularity of the traveling exhibition which has been touring Europe since 2021 Its currently being shown simultaneously in Stockholm Hanover and Cologne the exhibitions twentieth stop where its been on display since November 3\n","According to the promoter  who usually books music stars like David Garrett on Germanys stages or organizes newfangled immersive exhibitions about Tutankhamun or Salvador Dali  more than two million people have already visited the Banksy show The agency says that in Cologne alone 15000 tickets were sold within a short time on the opening weekend\n","The Cologne exhibition is being housed in an former car dealership while in Hanover it is on display in a shuttered supermarket helping to revitalize the city center According to the curator of the show Virginia Jean Many visitors travel several hours to see a Banksy exhibition despite the fact that the exhibition does not feature a single Banksy original\n","We deliberately avoid using originals says Jean We dont see our project as a Banksy exhibition but as a tribute to this artist A team of thirty people including specialist installers electricians and six professional graffiti artists set up the exhibition in the empty space in just ten days  a masterpiece in itself\n","Visitors get to see quite a bit for their 20 2135 entrance fee nearly 200 works ranging from street art sculptures videos and installations are displayed across some 400 square meters 4306 sq feet\n","Some of Banksys most spectacular installations are recreated in fifteen rooms such as The Elephant in the Room The animal decorated with wallpaper patterns once stood in the middle of a Los Angeles gallery in a replica 1950era living room highlighting poverty and injustice in the world At the opening there was a real elephant in the room as well as a real Angelina Jolie  and maybe even a real Banksy who knows\n","The Cologne show has a room thats meant to depict the artists studio featuring a hoodieclad figure sitting at a table This tableau was probably copied from one of the exhibition rooms of the authorized show in Glasgow So its possibly how Banksys studio actually looks\n","But what does Banksy himself think of commercial projects like this Does he not care Is he outraged and only unable to protest because doing otherwise would risk his anonymity Or is this kind of fairground Banksy show a new prank by the inventive artist\n","Fittingly the organizers want to neither confirm nor deny such speculation All they will say is that they are in contact with the managers of the Banksy brand\n","And theyre directing a portion of the profits to the Banksy Foundation to finance among other things the Louise Michel rescue boat Named after the French anarchist Michel the 30meter 98foot former yacht and its crew of ten have been rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean since 2020\n","This article has been adapted from German\n","The exhibition runs through March 17

going to flee Samuel asks his parents No his father replies We are going to be brave and stay right here\n","Shortly after Samuel is sent to his room He listens to his parents talk Its not safe he hears his mother say Were as good as dead if we stay here\n"," We have nowhere to go his father replies What choice do we have \n","They have no choice The Jewish family is torn apart First the father is deported then the mother and finally the boy All die in the Auschwitz concentration camp\n","The video game The Light in the Darkness then rolls the closing credits that incorporates black and white photographs of children who did not survive the Holocaust  when more than six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis\n","I cant get over the 6 million dead I cant get over it Luc Bernard told DW I remember those who died I am not just reducing them to numbers because to me they were kind of our families friends neighbors and citizens\n","Raised in France and now based in US the 37yearold British Jewish game developer created The Light in the Darkness almost entirely by himself\n","Its a project close to his heart that hes been carrying around since 2008 But it took almost 15 years before he could finally release the game\n","There are so many World War II games but none about the Holocaust he said adding that changing that was his motivation The rise in antisemitism around the world frightens him he explained I think its just going to continue to get worse Unless we change the way we do Holocaust awareness\n","For a long time it was taboo to depict the horrors of the Naziera in a computer game Bernard was considered the Holocaust guy within the games industry He did not receive any funding or support from NGOs He put all his own money into the game and still offers it for free\n","Only now after the game has been released is he receiving encouragement  mainly from Europe but also from the Israeli government In the first few weeks after its release some 100000 people downloaded his game he says\n","The more time that passes since the Holocaust the more difficult it is to create a social awareness of the mass murder of Jews says Bernard He wants to use his game to draw young peoples attention to the subject in particular arguing for the importance of reaching them with content instead of hoping they will go to museums or visit memorial sites of their own accord \n","Bernards own family history was affected by the Nazis His British grandmother whose first husband was a German Jew cared for Jewish children who were brought to safety from Germany to Britain in 1938 and 1939 on the Kindertransport Childrens Transport an organized rescue effort for children\n","In the video game industry if Im honest as a Jewish person in the gaming industry Jews dont really seem to count much in terms of representation And our history and trauma doesnt really seem to count much says Bernard\n","Although World War II has for decades been one of the most popular historical settings for video games especially in the strategy and firstperson shooter genres these stories are usually told from a military point of view \n","The players are either heroic US Army soldiers saving the world from the Nazis or they command troops and recreate battles But one central historical aspect almost always remains unmentioned the Nazi genocide of Europes Jews\n","But games influence our cultural memory and color our concept of historical events\n","Its problematic for the Holocaust to not appear in games says Christian Huberts of the Foundation for Digital Games Culture which wants to encourage developers to have greater sensitivity towards this topic \n","Huberts told DW that while it may have been unthinkable a decade ago to represent Nazi crimes in video games theres since been a shift in sensibilities within the games industry\n","Now games are criticized for completely ignoring the persecution of Jews or for falsely representing history\n","For example the firstperson shooter Wolfenstein II The New Colossus which is set in an alternate reality in which the Nazis won World War II and have occupied the United States has particularly polarized opinion\n","Its a longstanding game series that sparked a scandal in the 1990s due to the high levels of violence depicted\n","There are two versions of the game released in 2017  a German version and an international one\n","Due to laws in Germany banning the depiction of unconstitutional symbols such as Nazi swastikas in public  including in video games  all elements of the game that could be illegal in Germany were removed from the German version\n","The result was that Adolf Hitler was called Herr Heiler and didnt have a mustache And the protagonists mother was no longer Jewish but instead was described as a traitor who is arrested and killed explains Christian Hubert That means that the German version of the game deliberately disregards the persecution of the Jews\n","These measures sparked a debate that ultimately led to the legal framework in Germany being adjusted Since then video games may also show unconstitutional symbols when their depiction serves to promote the arts or science research or teaching reporting about current or historical events or similar purposes\n","Studies by the Jewish Claims Conference which works to provide compensation and support for victims of Nazism have found that many people in the US France Canada the Netherlands and Austria are unaware of the Holocaust Especially among Millennials and Generation Z many are convinced that the number of Jews killed has been exaggerated Some even believe the Holocaust never happened\n","At the same time games are the main entertainment medium for more than half of all Millennials So why not link Holocaust remembrance with games\n","Video games are a good way to learn confirms Huberts They can make it possible to directly experience not only historical spaces and landscapes but also how political systems work\n","For example if players are given fewer and fewer opportunities to intervene in a plot they could experience how a fascist political system can spread its power how rights suddenly disappear Huberts explained\n","But most players tend to ignore educational or serious games\n","Thats why Berlinbased studio Paintbucket Games is taking a different approach Founders Jrg Friedrich and Sebastian Schulz want to make games that distinguish themselves from common themes\n","Theyre behind the 2020 strategy game Through the Darkest of Times in which players lead a resistance group of civilians fighting against the Nazi regime between 1933 to 1945\n","And in the studios detective game The Darkest Files released in 2023 players slip into the role of a fictional prosecutor uncovering real Nazi crimes The boss is Fritz Bauer 19031968 who played an essential role in launching the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials\n","Were not trying to produce software thats admonishing moralizing instructional Friedrich told DW We want to create an interesting exciting engaging game that gives a topic long neglected in games the attention its due\n","Video games shouldnt replace books exhibitions and documentaries about the Holocaust\n","But they can be a good supplement and have the potential to reach people who otherwise pay little attention to the persecution and extermination of Jews under Nazism according to games developer Luc Bernard \n","There just need to be more games about that period he said Not just war games \n","This article was

their farewells to local leaders with South Korean media speculating that more North Korean embassies across Africa may be forced to close in the coming months because of Pyongyangs financial difficulties\n","It is clear that they are having financial problems and their international position is becoming increasingly isolated but it may also be that Pyongyang does not really have a direct interest in some of these countries anymore said Lim Eunjung an associate professor of international studies at Kongju National University in South Korea\n","Despite the sanctions the North is not completely broke and it is likely that they want to focus their financial resources on their nuclear and longrange missile capabilities as well as the surveillance satellite that they have promised to launch in the near future she told DW\n","Lim added that North Korea is not receiving as warm a welcome in many African nations as it used to\n","Angola for example accepted around 3000 military advisers in the 1970s and 1980s These troops were tasked with training local troops but also fought against South African forces\n","The Angolan government began to distance itself from the North in 2019 when under UN pressure it deported nearly 300 North Koreans\n","North Korean troops also trained Ugandan military personnel including in martial arts and there have been suggestions that North Korean light weapons were imported into the country\n","Pyongyang cultivated close ties with Ethiopia and Kenya and was a longterm ally of Zimbabwe which as recently as 2013 signed an agreement to export yellowcake from its mines in Kanyemba to North Korea Pyongyang paid for the nuclear fuel with weapons\n","It remains to be seen whether international pressure on these governments will be sufficient to encourage them to distance themselves now Lim said\n","Lots of countries in the global south now see a greater risk in having close ties with North Korea and they no longer see it as a desirable diplomatic partner she said North Koreas behavior has often been outrageous to the international community and they will no longer tolerate it\n","North Korea has moved swiftly to offset such snubs however she said\n","It has got much closer to Moscow for its own survival which is not unexpected Lim added\n","Immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine last year North Korea was supportive and now it is supplying artillery shells and other weapons for the war In return it is receiving fuel and food both of which it desperately needs but cannot get from the African countries\n","\n","Toshimitsu Shigemura a professor at Tokyos Waseda University and an expert on the North Korean leadership concurs that the high cost of operating diplomatic missions overseas will have been an important factor behind Pyongyangs decision to close some down but there are other considerations\n","The Norths embassies do not receive any money from Pyongyang and they are forced to earn their own incomes he told DW\n","The easiest way of doing that is often illegal he added with North Korean diplomats in the past implicated in the smuggling of counterfeit cigarettes currency synthetic narcotics weapons and even rhino horn often through the diplomatic pouch\n","Many countries have got wise to Pyongyangs subterfuge however and have made it far more difficult for diplomats to smuggle contraband Shigemura said\n","Japans Yomiuri newspaper has also reported that North Korea will close the consulate that it opened in Hong Kong in 1999 two years after the former British colony was returned to Chinese control\n","The consulate has widely been seen as one of the Norths most important overseas outstations and overlooked by Chinese authorities was involved in efforts to circumvent sanctions by arranging illicit shipments of fuel and other banned goods that could be transshipped to North Korean ships at sea\n","I also believe the North is worried about more of its diplomats defecting which has been a major source of embarrassment in the past said Shigemura\n","Thae Yongho the former deputy ambassador to London defected with his family in 2016 and has since been elected to the South Korean parliament where he is a vocal critic of Pyongyang\n","Similarly former North Korean ambassador to Italy Jo Songgil disappeared with his wife in 2020 and now lives in South Korea while the following year Ryu Hyunwoo the former acting envoy to Kuwait also defected\n","A lot of these diplomats enjoyed living abroad and did not want to go back to North Korea so they defected Shigemura said\n","To the leaders in Pyongyang thats treason but its also humiliating\n","\n","Edited by Shamil Shams\n","\n","\n","\n","'*** Gay Games in Hong Kong, Guadalajara: What you

massive protests against the government in recent years\n","The awarding of the Games to Hong Kong has therefore drawn criticism but organizers say they hope the Games and their message of inclusivity can help improve the situation both in Hong Kong and across Asia generally\n","We believe that hosting the Games for the very first time here will be a momentous experience and a cornerstone for our Asian community as well as for the whole world GGHK can bring all of us together in the name of Sport Fairness Respect and Friendship reads the official website\n","The organizers estimate that 221

****'\n","\n","It was 300 years ago in 1723 that Johann Sebastian Bach took up the position of Thomaskantor or music director of St Thomas Choir in Leipzig So of course the citys Bach Festival in 2023 was a giant anniversary celebration\n","Bach was the not the first choice of the Leipzig City Counsellors to become Thomaskantor They would have preferred the very experienced and very famous Georg Philipp Telemann but they couldnt tempt him away from Hamburg where he was getting a better salary for a comparable position Another composer Christoph Graupner was also on the shortlist but he was still in the services of a count and it would have cost too much to release him from the contract It was only half a year later that the Leipzig Counsellors thought of Johann Sebastian Bach the talented Kapellmeister from the nearby city of Kthen\n","The big day finally arrived on May 30 1723 Bach conducted the early mass in Leipzigs St Nicholas Church for the parish community He had composed the cantata Die Elenden sollen essen The poor shall eat for his debut and it remains one his most popular cantatas to this day\n","The work consists of two parts and was written so that the sermon could be interspersed among the music This may be the reason that the total length around 35 minutes didnt raise any eyebrows You see there was clause in Bachs contract that said his music should be neither too long nor too operatic and that it should move people to solemn reflection\n","The subject of the Bach cantata Die Elenden sollen essen or The poor shall eat is the moment in the Gospel of St Luke when Lazarus is compared to the rich man The story is a call to help the poor in order to secure a place in heaven and to practice Christian brotherly love\n","Andreas Reize who is by the way the 18th person to hold the Thomaskantor position after Bach tells us more Bach made his debut with a bang with Die Elenden sollen essen You really get the sense that he wanted to make his ambitions clear coming from his position as Kapellmeister from Kthen There are lots of dancelike movements an overture at the start which then flows into this lamento  extremely impressive\n","Bach festival director Michael Maul sees the seeds of Bachs later works in this cantata In modern terms I would call it a kind of trailer for a large musical series where  just as in a good movie trailer  you get glimpses of all the unique moments that will then be shown more fully in the film\n","Both the St Thomas Choir a boys choir and the Gewandhaus Orchestra have deep historic roots in Leipzig The Gewandhaus Orchestra is the oldest civic as in nonroyal symphony orchestra in the world It was founded in 1743 by 16 nobles and nonnobles and was initially a sort of private concert enterprise Today in addition to packed concert seasons the renowned orchestra also performs Bach cantatas on a weekly basis in St Thomas Church Theyre joined there by the St Thomas Choir which is also internationally famous thanks in part to extensive touring The choir has been around for 800 years but its only since Bach that the Thomaskantor or music director of the choir has been numbered He was literally number one\n","2023 was the 300th anniversary of Bach becoming the Thomaskantor To celebrate the city of Leipzigs annual Bach Festival took place under the motto Bach for Future They wanted to highlight how Bach remains relevant today and continues to inspire new ideas in contemporary composers\n","It was along those lines that the Bach Festival commissioned clarinetist conductor and composer Jrg Widmann to compose a cantata that reflects the presentday\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Widmann sees his cantata as a journey It starts by doubting the existence of God and ends by singing of peace and praising God with hallelujahs This final text is by Paul Gerhard a poet whose texts Bach also set to music\n","Widmann used the traditional cantata form featuring solos and chorales but he made it his own by including texts from different sources and by different authors War and peace were the themes of the work but Widmann wasnt thinking only of the war in Ukraine when he composed the cantata Rather he was thinking of war in general and throughout all time He explains  In this commission I got from the Bachfest it was not possible to simply say Oh yes lets praise God and lets praise Bach and then lets go home You know its not enough I think its really necessary to address these things Therefore my piece ends with a very short but urgent call for peace You know call me naive yes probably rightly so And by the way naivety in a well understood sense is a kind of precondition to make music to make arts So nothing against naivety in a wellunderstood sense\n","Those deep thoughts from composer Jrg Widmann close out this Deutsche Welle Festival Concert\n","Performances in this recording\n","All music recorded by the Bach Festival and

the Philippines Bustamante said in a statement on McLarens website\n","I still have a hard time seeing my name next to McLaren without getting emotional as the history and heritage linked to this team leaves me truly speechless\n","In May 2023 Bustamante won her first race in the F1 Academy winning the second of three races in Valencia\n","When I won it was like the whole world suddenly exploded Bustamante told DW in June\n","The 18yearold received a message from the president of the Philippines had a resolution voiced on the countrys senate floor and saw her face splashed across an enormous billboard on the busiest street in Manila\n","I honestly didnt know how to react I wasnt expecting the effect would be this much It was really a crazy moment for me To experience all this stuff at 18 sometimes I think its a bit too much she said\n","It would be easy to dismiss this response as classic athlete hyperbole but Bustamantes journey to this point explains why the tears flowed and the country celebrated when the teenager stood on the podium\n","Her father a motorsport fanatic bought Bustamante her first suit when she was just 1 She was in a baby race cart by age three and at just six years old Bustamante knew a life in motorsport was what she wanted\n","Financially it definitely wasnt easy for us You know coming from the Philippines were a very middleclass family My dad is actually an overseas worker He moved away when I was young just so he could support the family and put food on the table she said\n","The fact that I was racing it was really really difficult for the whole family We made a lot of sacrifices sometimes you might say too many Thats why Ive always felt like Ive had to pay them back\n","Many aiming to be in professional sports say failure isnt an option and yet for one of myriad reasons that make being a professional athlete so hard never make it Like them Bustamante never had a prom or sleepovers and has been homeschooled for most of her life A lot of what makes a typical childhood has been missing\n","Five seven years ago we were just struggling to even pay for the entry fee fuel tires It made for a difficult road and because of that I needed to really value every time I was just able to drive to race because I never really knew when it would be the last time\n","Life hasnt been easy for Bustamante but one mantra has helped her through When lifes tough youve got to be tougher\n","That approach has helped her go from karting glory as a child to the top rookie in the W Series an allfemale singleseater championship last year In 2023 she is set to finish in the top 7 of the 2023 F1 Academy racing for Prema Racing  the starting point for many F1 talents such as Ferraris Charles Leclerc\n","To be here is a testament to

told DW\n","Theres a lot of moments where you kind of have a crash You have so much adrenaline during a race weekend and then suddenly youre back to being by yourself Its one of the struggles\n","Its a poignant reminder of the mental fortitude needed when competing at the highest level Family support helps perhaps none more so than the bond she shares with her brother\n","I have a brother and he has autism and Down syndrome I think having him really taught me how to not only think of myself but to be very selfless with a lot of things because with him Ive always had to be selfless with moments where I needed to be very patient forgiving when he would throw tantrums Bustamante said adding that after her win in Valencia her brother was one of the first people she called\n","And I think thats why Ive always been really really patient with life dealing with difficulties losing progress patience just with everything With that comes a lot of maturity To not act on your emotions or whats around you or in the moment it really takes a lot of selfcontrol and discipline\n","Its no surprise that her end goal is to join the biggest show in motorsport\n","The end goal for me is making it to Formula One Thats my Everest Bustamante told DW Everything Im doing is to hopefully make it there\n","Last year at Hungaroring Bustamante got a taste of the big show when she met seventime F1 champion Lewis Hamilton The two bonded over the similarities of their journeys two aspiring drivers who didnt look like anyone on the grid For the teenager the meeting was a moment shell always cherish and she credits Hamilton as one of the original supporters of the existence of the F1 Academy\n","Lewis has always supported women in motorsport He was one of the first few people who really stood up for it and said We need to have an initiative to support women Looking back five years ago there wasnt even an initiative for women in the sport she said\n","The fact that now its not just about us drivers but even engineers like McLaren launching their new women program for STEM engineers  thats amazing Bustamante said referring to the science technology engineering and math courses that lay the foundation for a career in motorsport The teenager has herself specialized in STEM and was as of early June on the verge of graduating\n","By securing a deal with McLaren Bustamante has not just taken a huge step towards realizing her goal of being on the F1 grid at some point in the future but shes also paved the way for women in motorsports and in the Philippines Bustamante is just getting started and the teenager has a lot more to do including hopefully making more phone calls to her brother after a race win\n","Edited by James Thorogood\n","\n","\n","\"*** '20 Days in Mariupol' director: Fight in Ukraine goes on 17.10.2023 ****\"\n","A pregnant woman is carried away on a stretcher after a Russian missile strike on a maternity hospital This shocking image from the Siege of Mariupol traveled around the world\n","The reason it exists in the first place is thanks to the Ukrainian war correspondents working for the Associated Press who remained in the city when it was encircled and extensively bombed by Russian troops\n","They were the last team of international journalists on site covering the first 20 days of the siege that left the city in ruins\n","The Ukrainian reporters Mstyslav Chernov Evgeniy Maloletka Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their work as well as many other awards  including the Deutsche Well Freedom of Speech Award\n","Mstyslav Chernov then turned his video footage into a film titled 20 days in Mariupol\n","The documentary has been selected as Ukraines submission to the 2024 Oscars in the best international feature category\n","The film which has also won the World Cinema documentary prize following its Sundance premiere celebrated its German premiere at Berlins Human Rights Film Festival where DW met the filmmaker\n","The documentary goes way beyond the news stories using the Associated Press material that was widely broadcast around the world\n","That was one of the main reasons why this film needed to be made says Chernov The impressions you get from oneminute to twominute news pieces is very different to what you feel and what you understand when you watch 95 minutes which he says is still not enough to speak about all the tragedies that happened in Mariupol  even the 30 hours of video footage that I managed to get out from the city is not enough\n","The estimated number of Ukrainians killed in besieged Mariupol varies greatly the film cites the Ukrainian count of more than 25000 deaths\n","According to UN estimates 90 of the citys apartment buildings and 60 of singlefamily homes were damaged\n","Meanwhile Russia is knocking down those destroyed buildings and is building new ones just to make good pictures says Chernov thereby erasing the locations that could help determine the scale of the war crimes committed by Russia There is less and less evidence left with every every single day that passes by\n","20 Day in Mariupol portrays not only from the inside how a modern European city was bombed to ruins how children fell victim to the missiles and how mass graves had to be created to bury thousands of bodies but also provides a reminder of how Russia framed the events\n","At the beginning of the film Vladimir Putin is shown stating in a televised speech at the launch of the invasion that his special military operation is absolutely necessary because otherwise Russia would be attacked first As one Mariupol resident puts it sarcastically in the film the Russian leader was beautifully so beautifully deceptive in his speech\n","This reminder that the whole conflict is based on Putins lies makes the images of its bloody impact even more painful to watch\n","As the medical team in the hospital where the Associated Press journalists were based desperately tried to revive a toddler badly wounded by Russian shells or operate a teenager whose legs were blown off while playing soccer the head surgeon encourages Chernov to film every gory detail Show that Putin bastard the eyes of this child he yells Show what these motherfkers are doing to civilians\n","As Chernov states in the films narration This is painful to watch but it must be painful to watch\n","The Ukrainian reporters managed to send their reports to Western media at the risk of their lives as they often had to reach uncovered spots where WiFi might still be available\n","But Russia was quick to label the images as fake news\n","As they were released the Russian Embassy in London tweeted that that the pregnant woman shown in the AP photos was an actress The documentary also shows a clip of a British journalist confronting the Kremlins ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya with Chernovs footage the diplomat brushes off the question about the killing of babies as information wars\n","Its impossible to tell the story of Mariupol completely without telling how much misinformation and misinterpretation is connected to it Chernov tells DW As we discuss the topic of war reporting the filmmaker however stresses that his film is not about journalists Its the story of my people who were trapped killed lost their homes says the director who was born in Kharkiv another border city that was hard hit by the Russians\n","Nevertheless 20 Days in Mariupol also chronicles a modernage phenomenon that is harming the work of journalists globally as fake news is contaminating the coverage of all contested issues  as is currently the case in the war between terrorist group Hamas and Israel\n","Asked if hes worried that the world will start forgetting the Ukrainians as the Middle East flares up the war reporter realistically points out The shifting of the medias attention was inevitable We work in the news We know that attention shifts and comes back later Chernov is also well aware that both conflicts are geopolitically connected\n","But he adds some parts of European society are mistaken in their belief that if only weapons were no longer delivered to Ukraine war would stop and peace negotiations would happen I dont think that a shift in international support for Ukraine will stop the fight Ukrainians are fighting for their survival So it just means that more Ukrainians will die because nobody will watch nobody will help\n","The 2023 Human Rights Film Festival Berlin is held from October

the militant Islamist Hamas numerous Hollywood stars and other cultural figures in the US expressed their solidarity with the country under the hashtag standwithisrael\n","On October 12 700 Hollywood stars including actors Gal Gadot Jamie Lee Curtis Michael Douglas and Chris Pine as well as comedians Jerry Seinfeld and Amy Schumer signed an open letter created by the nonprofit organization Creative Community for Peace\n","The Hollywood stars condemned the Hamas assault as barbaric acts of terrorism and called on Hamas which is classified as a terrorist organization by the US Germany the EU and others to release its Israeli hostages\n","They also warned their entertainment industry colleagues against misinformation on social media saying As Israel takes the necessary steps to defend its citizens in the coming days and weeks social media will be overrun by an orchestrated misinformation campaign spearheaded by Iran We urge everyone to remember the horrific images that came out of Israel and to not amplify or fall for their propaganda\n","In several German cities including Berlin Munich and Rostock many have demonstrated their solidarity with Israel at rallies in recent days\n","But Germanys cultural institutions remained reticent For example it was not until October 11 four days after the attacks that the German Cultural Council issued a statement that said it resolutely opposes any form of antisemitism and called on cultural institutions in Germany to clearly show their solidarity with Israel\n","\n","From this call it is perhaps possible to see what journalist and author Simon Strauss denounced in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Where are the Israeli flags Where are the banners the posters the placards\n","Comparing the situation with the prompt declarations of solidarity with Ukraine following Russias invasion Strauss made it very clear in his article what he actually expects from Germany More solidarity with Israel After all Israels security and right to exist is Germanys reason of state after Germanys systematic murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust This reason of state is supported by the current governments coalition agreement and has been reaffirmed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a government statement on October 12 2023\n","In his October 11 Spiegel Online column titled Why are you still silent author Sascha Lobo elaborated the manifold reasons for the stubborn silence of many people who otherwise regularly speak out about grievances on social media\n","He concludes by saying Those who live in Germany today are not to blame for the Holocaust But all those living here bear the responsibility to learn from it And that can in no way mean remaining silent about antisemitic terrorism\n","The silence does not seem to be just a German problem On the Artnet news site which focuses on the international art trade Jewish editor Katya Kazakina wrote of a deafening silence in the art world  especially from renowned and longestablished galleries and museums which in the past frequently spoke out when it came to defending human rights as in the case of the Ukraine war Black Lives Matter or LGBTQ rights\n","In New York the home of the largest Jewish population outside of Israel not a single major museum has so far expressed its official support for the Jewish state and by extension the Jewish people Kazakina wrote on October 12\n","Not one major gallery chose to send a message of empathy and take a public stand against the slaughter of Jewish civilians She added As a Jewish woman whos been writing about art artists galleries museums auction houses foundations fairs and lawsuits for more than 17 years I feel a mixture of pain disappointment rage and fear  Where is the solidarity Where is the empathy Where is the moral compass\n","In their articles Strauss Lobo and Kazakina look for reasons why so little solidarity with Israel has been shown so far Is it the fear of being seen as a colonialist in view of the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population in the Gaza Strip Or is it ultimately antisemitic tendencies that have led to this deafening silence\n","Perhaps it is also the fear of Islamist terrorism For example the organizer of the solidarity demonstration for Israel in Munich has received death threats\n","There may be many reasons for this silence but the result remains the same People of Jewish faith already deeply shocked by the current events in Israel are now further unsettled by this\n","\n","This article was originally

1954\n","At that time his film production company had already been in business for more than 30 years and was one of the most successful in the US  with cartoons\n","Mickey Mouse had not only become a screen hero but was already smiling on Tshirts footballs and toothbrush cups One year later in 1955 the cartoon mouse even came to life at the first Disneyland to open in California\n","Walt Disney who was born in 1901 and grew up on a farm in Missouri started out as a commercial artist and then discovered animated films With just 40 in his pocket he set off for Hollywood and on October 16 1923 founded the Walt Disney Company today a billiondollar enterprise\n","Its kind of fun to do the impossible was one of the cartoon pioneers convictions\n","Hidden behind this carefree statement was an intense almost manic work ethic and workload but also an unwavering belief in his own ideas Time and again the farm boy was on the verge of bankruptcy His projects were considered too daring with the latest film technology always being tested and and perfected Driven Walt Disney was soon sleeping on a couch in his studios hardly seeing his own children yet working hard in order to enchant other unfamiliar children with his onscreen fairy tales\n","Walt Disney made film history in 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first fulllength animated film to hit theaters  Mickey Mouse and Co had previously only starred in short films At the time no one could have guessed that an additional 60 featurelength films would follow to this day\n","After all the daring producer Walt Disney had made a dramatic miscalculation Instead of 250000 approx 228000 15 million were required to complete the film instead of 18 months his cartoonists worked for three years on an idea that was considered complete lunacy in Hollywood A featurelength animated film Whos going to line up at the box office for that\n","As became apparent after the films release it turned out that quite a few people would Snow White grossed around 8 million  at a time when a movie ticket cost an average of 25 US cents\n","Translated into 10 languages the film went on to be a box office smash in 46 more countries\n","Disney received an honorary Oscar at the following years Academy Awards  or more precisely and true to the films title eight one normalsized plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes\n","Working at Walt Disney Studios on the other hand was allegedly not always a fairy tale\n","Requirements to work overtime poor wages and a boss who micromanaged every stroke of the pen those were the working conditions at the company along with a boss whose creative ego demanded one name be shown in the opening credits  that of he himself Walt Disney\n","Even today his signature adorns the logo of the billiondollar corporation\n","Yet it wasnt Walt Disneys talent alone that led to the success of the company  He founded the studios together with his brother Roy who later took over the finances\n","The mouse that started it all was designed by art director Ub Iwerks but apparently according to the strict specifications of the characters inventor\n","\n","Incidentally Mickey Mouse was also created during an entrepreneurial low point during a train journey back to Los Angeles In New York Walt Disney had been unable to reach an agreement with a distributor who snatched his then successful short cartoons Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from right under his nose\n","Walt Disney was both a visionary and a businessman And he had a knack for discovering talented people\n","Oddly it was during the Great Depression at the end of the 1920s when companies went bankrupt and many families became desperately poor that merchandising was born\n","With the ingenious advertising manager Kay Kamen on board Mickey Mouses likeness was emblazoned on socks cereal boxes and footballs from the 1930s onward Disney Studios soon earned considerably more from their advertising products than from the films themselves\n","They are still a central source of income for the company worth billions of dollars today\n","\n","Following Snow White Pinocchio 1940 Dumbo 1941 and Bambi 1942 were among the films Disney Studios released But the films were unable to match the success of Snow White The anticipated revenues failed to materialize partly because the European sales market collapsed due to the Second World War\n","Since hardly any banks could be found to provide the necessary loans for new productions the company went public\n","Today according to the Institute for Media and Communications Policy the Walt Disney Company ranks sixth among the worlds most successful media groups and is part of the Dow Jones stock index which lists the 30 most successful US companies\n","During World War II Disney Studios became an instrument of US propaganda The studios produced numerous short films and cartoons that glorified US warfare and reproduced stereotypical images of the enemy\n","For example in the wellknown propaganda film Der Fuehrers Face 1943 Donald Duck is forced to work in an armaments factory in Nazi Germany and goes crazy hearing shouts of Heil Hitler\n","Likewise Disney produced educational and training films for the US Army Critics complained that the company would have been better off spreading pacifist and humanist messages instead of war propaganda\n","In the postWorld War II years Disney built on the success of his featurelength films  with Alice in Wonderland 1951 and Peter Pan 1953\n","In 1955 Walt Disney had another crazy idea his fairy tale worlds were to become reality and so the first Disneyland was built in the US state of California Later offshoots followed in Florida Paris Tokyo Hong Kong and Shanghai\n","Walt Disney was awarded 26 Oscars during his lifetime  an unprecedented record However he did not live to see the premiere of his last film The Jungle Book 1967 as he died of lung cancer in 1966\n","Still the Disney brand lived on despite a massive financial crisis during the early 1980s In 1986 Walts nephew Roy E Disney took over management of the animation studio and together with Jeffrey Katzenberg led a Disney renaissance The Little Mermaid 1989 Beauty and the Beast 1991 and The Lion King 1994 were born\n","I think when you relate Disney to anything you relate it to magic and imagination and creativity and I think thats whats so different about our company Its that we tell stories and we make magic in everything that we do Betty Cline director of the Walt Disney Archive told DW\n","From the 2000s onward the former cartoon company set its sights on expansion First it bought the successful animation studio Pixar with whom it had already produced films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo then swallowed the numerous superhero films with Marvel and finally the longrunning box office hit company Lucasfilm with the Star Wars series TV series and several prequels sequels and spinoffs followed\n","Of course in the spirit of its founder Disney continues to keep pace with technological innovations Although its own streaming platform Disney started somewhat late in 2019 and stumbled at first its quarterly figures for 2022 now position it in third place worldwide behind Netflix and Amazon Prime\n","While the billiondollar corporation may be able to safely overcome financial hurdles its former core business  fairytale films  has come under fire Following allegations of racist depictions in classics such as Dumbo or The Jungle Book Disney began adding warning labels to its films\n","In response to criticism of cultural appropriation such as in the marketing of the Swahili saying Hakuna Matata loosely No worries from the 1994 film The Lion King the corporation is also now trying to deal more sensitively with the cultural attributes of other nations and peoples So on the occasion of the 100th anniversary it launched the longawaited liveaction film version of The

the humanitarian issue worsens\n","Guido Steinberg senior associate at the Berlinbased think tank German Institute for International and Security Affairs and author of several books on terrorism in the Middle East sees Qatars mediating role in the current conflict as feasible given the emirates good relations with opposing political actors \n","For example Qatar maintains a large US airbase

era allowed developers to be more creative in the depiction of the location They used as sources of inspiration a book about Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate by English scholar Guy Le Strange

basic interest in us as humans to think about where we come from At the same time what appeals to us about history is the strangeness of the past era theres an almost constant interplay between this familiarity and strangeness says historian Lucas Haasis Time travel in a video game combines both levels at the same time And these virtual journeys naturally take place in a protected space you have

members once considered enlargement skeptics now agree that its time to start thinking seriously about welcoming hopefuls like Ukraine Moldova and Western Balkan states into the club\n","The shift was prompted by Russias fullscale invasion of Ukraine Before then loose plans for expanding were Brussels favorite proverbial can to kick down the road passed from one administration to the next while aspirant members such as North Macedonia  an EU candidate since 2005  jumped through a series of shapeshifting political and judicial hoops to qualify for access without ever exiting the waiting room\n","These days the mindset has changed As one EU diplomat put it Enlargement is a reality now and it wasnt a year and a half ago\n","But Brussels has its own homework to do if the political consensus is to become a practical path Before you can have a realistic conversation with the countries coming in we have to figure out what an enlarged EU would actually look like  and thats as far as weve gotten the diplomat who asked not to be named told DW We know the questions but we dont really know the answers to them\n","The conversation has however begun Earlier this month a group of researchers commissioned by France and Germany unveiled a paper full of ideas on the workings of and pathway toward a larger union Thu Nguyen a senior policy fellow at the Jacques Delors Centre in Berlin was among them She told DW that rethinking how the EU takes decisions could prove most politically challenging\n","The official list of EU candidate countries is long Ukraine MoldovaAlbania Montenegro Bosnia and Herzegovina North Macedonia Serbia and Turkey Georgia and Kosovo are also considered potential candidates\n","But even with 27 members the bloc sometimes struggles to take action Foreign policy moves like sanctioning Russia require unanimous backing meaning negotiations can sometimes take months as member states hash out which products to ban or whose assets to freeze\n","Changes to other policy areas like migration and asylum require support from a qualified majority of EU members  meaning at least 15 states which also represent at least 65 of the blocs population Last week the limits of this political arithmatic were also on display when Germany greenlit reforms to a new rulebook for migration crises only for fellow heavyweight Italy to swiftly walk out and leave the deal deadlocked\n","Under the current system Ukraine  with its population of more than 40 million  would become one of the most politically powerful countries in the EU Meanwhile each smaller Western Balkan state such as Montenegro  population circa 620000  or Albania with its roughly 27 million inhabitants  would add more voices into the mix\n","The more the member states there are the more risk of having veto players that block decisions Nguyen said That could prove even tougher for politicallyloaded calls like blocking EU funds to countries accused of breaching rule of law standards\n","Nguyen and her coauthors therefore suggest scrapping unanimity and recalculating qualified majority voting shares to make sure a bigger EU still has the capacity to act Controversially that proposal would also make it more difficult for big powers France and Germany to block agreement\n","But such reforms would require a rewrite of the blocs founding laws and need support from member states who would lose power in the reshuffle And as Nguyen acknowledges the political mood currently is not very favorable toward treaty change\n","\n","Then theres the question of how to divvy up EU funds across deeper economic disparities Most EU candidates have a lower GDP per capita than the blocs current poorest member Bulgaria  and with around a third of Brussels current budget assigned to agriculture subsidies the arrival of farming powerhouse Ukraine would radically shift the current disribution sheet\n","Last month Poland Slovakia and Hungary announced plans for unilateral embargoes on Ukrainian grain to protect their own producers from potential price drops For the EUs former trade commissioner Phil Hogan this shows the rocky road ahead\n","Theres going to have to be huge institutional change huge budget change and policy adaptation to the new reality Hogan told DW Ukraine is a huge country with huge agricultural interests And the notion that you would overnight be able to deal with the issues of Ukraine becoming a fully integrated member of the European Unions agricultural policy is going to be a major challenge\n","Even in my time there were sensitivities around many trade issues with Ukraine he added Its nothing new to have tensions between Ukraine and Europe in relation to agriculture  but you can imagine the challenges are going to be ahead for the European farmers in the context of the Western Balkans and Ukraine and others becoming part and parcel of the family\n","Still Hogan remains hopeful I am very much in favor of the expansion of the European Union and bringing into our European fold countries that otherwise could go into a different fold that we may not like he said making a thinlyveiled allusion to Russian influence\n","Politics is about the art of the possible and I expect that the existing member states will stretch themselves and their citizens will stretch themselves to ensure that we have our neighbourhood in a less tense place\n","There are all sorts of smaller questions about the functioning of a larger EU which also need answers How many more lawmakers would enter the European Parliament How many more official EU languages would there be Could each country maintain a dedicated member of the European Commission\n","Given the legal and political quagmire that likely lies ahead some think its time to broaden the definition of the bloc This week as Europes leaders head to Spain for a third meeting of the European Political Community EPC one vision of a wider intergovernmental setup is on display\n","The EPC is the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron When he first publicly floated the idea in 2022 Macron said it could take decades for Ukraine to join the EU and argued for a new grouping that would allow democratic European nations to find a new space for political and security cooperation\n","Today the EPC is fomally nothing more than a talking shop with no established structures voting rights or treaties attached But it is the only forum of its kind uniting its broad church of 45 invitees It includes all EU countries and candidates wealthy nations staying an arms length from the bloc like Switzerland Norway and the United Kingdom and even political rivals Armenia and Azerbaijan Russia is not on the guestlist\n","For Thu Nguyen and her fellow researchers this looser structure could provide a clue about what might happen if the EU fails to agree on an expansion plan\n","They suggest there could be a core inner circle of closely integrated EU countries then the wider EU then a next level of associate members who enjoy some benefits linked to the blocs single market and an outer circle based on the EPC which Nguyen says would not include any form of integration with binding EU law but rather a cooperation based on geostrategic considerations\n","But this potential multispeed approach may prove unpopular seen by some as creating secondclass citizens in the EUs club Ukraines Prime Minister Dennis Shmyhal recently told news outlet Politico his country is performing all the maximum efforts to ensure that Ukraine would become a fullyfledged member of the European Union\n","The European Commission often insists accession is a meritbased process with no timeline Still European Council President Charles Michel recently said the bloc itself should be ready for enlargement by 2030\n","Thu Nguyen also backs an endofdecade target  but asked whether thats realistic she says simply Its difficult to make a prognosis\n","This is a very long term process Nguyen said Were very much at the beginning of the discussion and of the debate\n","Edited by Ben Knight\n","\n","\n","\n","'*** Asian Games: Five

Page hopes to demonstrate that is not the case with the exhibition Death and the Devil The Fascination with Horror on show at the Kunstpalast Dsseldorf\n","In recent decades the topic has only appeared marginally in major exhibitions as Page tells DW Unique in its approach the exhibition explores how horror has inspired creators in all artistic fields from fine art to fashion from music to film\n","The exhibition begins with a historical prologue that looks into how the arts and culture have been shaped by horror for centuries from the fantastic demons of the Renaissance to the dark shadows in Romantic landscape paintings to various iconic characters from the early horror films of the 20th century such as Nosferatu\n","The prologue shows that throughout history major artists such as Albrecht Drer Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow and Francisco de Goya also dealt with horror and dark dreams in their works\n","Above all my hope is that many visitors will then be able to interpret todays manifestations of horror differently and perhaps have more respect for them says the exhibitions curator\n","Through 120 exhibits  paintings illustrations and installations from various art forms from the past two centuries  Death and the Devil The Fascination with Horror shows how certain horror devices have been revisited over time\n","Excerpts from German Expressionist horror film classics such as Nosferatu 1922 or The Cabinet of Dr Caligari 1920 and posters from famous later horror classics such as The Exorcist 1973 or Halloween 1978 show the continuity with which horror has been inscribed in film history\n","\n","Horror films can promote both conservative and subversive values They can for example serve as a warning about the unknown but they can also enable a change of perspective about social issues by asking the question Who is the actual monster here\n","Ever since the first King Kong film the old heroversusmonster formula has been challenged\n","In many modern vampire films the bloodsuckers are no longer the villains but rather the main protagonists who have to find their way in a cruel society\n","A recurring theme in horror is that a central unit is threatened by something that comes from the outside\n","But this established storyline can also be used to swap roles in which the monster the witch the vampire or the outsider can assert an empowered otherness explains Westrey Page And this can also be used to question social norms to question systems of power And thats ultimately what were seeing more and more of in horror these days in very different genres including pop culture\n","The exhibition shows among other things how the looks of the younger Goth scene influenced the creations of fashion designers such as Rei Kawakubo Rick Owens and Viktor  Rolf\n","The aesthetics of Gothic Wave and especially Metal bands  whether on their record covers their band Tshirts or the lettering used for their names  are heavily inspired by old myths that deal with horror and disgust\n","Today this symbolism also appears in pop music Lady Gaga for example lovingly refers to her fans as Little Monsters\n","Horror has been going through a renaissance in recent years which is reflected among other things in the great international success of series such as The Walking Dead or Monster High a popular horror doll series from the Barbie manufacturer Mattel in which figures like Frankie Stein or Draculaura wreak havoc The franchises advertising slogan is Be yourself be unique be a monster\n","So its about celebrating and accepting ones own identity and differences says Page\n","When preparing the exhibition she herself was surprised by the diversity of the horror genre It can be serious it can be sociopolitical but it can also be charming Horror can be fun filled with black humor Its just so diverse\n","A sculpture by the US artist King Cobra with imitation flesh that explores the vulnerability of the body and the disgust

use on me as desired\n","The objects included razor blades knives and a loaded gun The artist sat motionless as people cut open her clothes or slashed her skin One person aimed the loaded gun at her head If you leave it up to the audience they can kill you Abramovic said after the performance in which she sought to expose an inherent human cruelty\n","Earlier that year her performance Rhythm 5 included a burning communist star She laid herself in the middle of it after cutting and burning her hair and nails When the fire had consumed all the oxygen Abramovic passed out\n","This career path

visitors must squeeze between two nude models to enter the show There is however a separate entrance for those who are uncomfortable with participating in the unusual performance\n","Marina Abramovic and Ulay lived as free spirits in their small Citroen bus for four years traveling through Europe and performing\n","Even their separation in 1988 was sealed with an elaborate performance In a piece titled The Lovers they walked towards each other along the Great Wall of China starting at opposite ends and meeting in the middle After covering some 4000 kilometers 2485 miles they said goodbye\n","The separation inspired the artist to break new ground\n","In 1997 she performed a work in the international section of the Venice Biennale titled Balkan Baroque a comment on the Yugoslav Wars in which she spent seven hours a day washing a mountain of bloody cow bones Her performance was awarded a Golden Lion\n","Since the 1990s she has also been teaching her Abramovic Method to young

cried \n","In the decade since her works have been characterized less by violence and more by asceticism and recollection Her method is based on a mix of various esoteric and eastern relaxation and meditation exercises She spends every years end in a monastery in India to meditate and recharge her batteries We have to create situations where our bodies are healthy and function well she said

death that wasnt induced by one of her extreme performances\n","During a minor operation at the hospital in May she suffered a pulmonary embolism that led her to undergo three operations and nine

the opportunities that lie in the use of artificial intelligence  AI for short  in game development\n","Many other gaming insiders have come to a similar conclusion According to a study by management consultancy Bain  Company published in September 2023 the majority of the gaming industry executives surveyed believe that AI will be involved in half of the development process in the next five to 10 years\n","For example in the roleplaying game Dimensionals developed by Sasha MacKinnons studio AI is built into a particular character who is a slightly crazy nice guy brimming with creativity who always joins the others at the table and keeps making one funny suggestion after the other\n","AI can generate characters fights and dialogues Were using AI to have these magical moments where the characters just say something that you totally didnt expect that really isnt scripted and is based on your history of playing with them\n","For now AI quickly reaches its limits 4050 of its suggestions are unusable says MacKinnon So at Mino Games AI serves as creative collaborator who provides ideas that are then implemented by humans\n","The sketches of the monsters for Dimensionals were generated by AI but the monsters that appear in the game were created by human designers\n","Game developers dont have to worry about their jobs says MacKinnon They cannot be replaced by AI he believes adding that games are the purest form of human expression as they not only combine story art and sound they also offer an experience for people AI will never ever be able to do that as well\n","Daniel Landes does not share this optimism He works as a freelance translator and adapts international games into German including Hogwarts Legacy and Overwatch 2\n","Translators usually work as freelancers and are paid per word Nobody gets rich from it But now as the use of AI is being required by game producers they are also expecting translators to be paid less for their work  only 30 of the original per word price\n","Translators would like to use the AI tools as an aid like mathematicians use a calculator explains Landes The main problem is that we are forced to work for less money even though it is not proven that work will be made easier The more complex a text is the worse the computer translation requiring more editing work The machine doesnt understand context but rather calculates probabilities says Landes Especially with dialogues or creative texts its not about translating literally but about capturing the meaning of the original AI cannot do that\n","The umbrella organization for audiovisual translators in Europe AVTE published a manifesto on AI translations in 2021 in which Daniel Landes was also involved The authors warn of a loss of quality question the efficiency of the tools and demand fair pay for translators\n","However there has been no improvement in the general conditions so far Because most translators are freelancers it is incredibly difficult to organize as a profession Many translators have to struggle very much to even make ends meet\n","Its not just in Germany that the profession is facing difficult times All translators worldwide are under pressure says  Landes We see the same problems everywhere Our names are not mentioned in the credits our fees keep being lowered and we have no say or right to negotiate\n","AI is only as good as the data it is fed with In addition it is by no means certain that AI will improve over time It can also get worse as researchers have found using ChatGPT as an example\n","It is therefore not unreasonable to think that the quality of games will be affected if AI is increasingly used\n","But since the technology is often faster and significantly cheaper than human translators game designers or copywriters it could still prevail and lead to people losing their jobs and studios simply accepting lower quality as the lesser evil\n","One of the biggest risks of AI is that people become complacent says game developer MacKinnon And this is one of the big things about AI in general Were at these crossroads You know it could be the best thing that happens or it could really damage humanity\n","We should not blindly rely on AI he points out but rather use it as a tool for example for inspiration And it should encourage people to develop their own stories and games He expects a flood of new games from people who have never developed a game before but are now able to do so thanks to the technical possibilities\n","In fact the most successful games in recent years have come about because existing games were modified and further developed by the community  ie by the players themselves not by the game industry\n","Among others CounterStrike emerged from a modification of the firstperson shooter game HalfLife\n","Fortnite is a variant of PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds whose battle royale concept  100 players compete against each other and the last survivor wins  was invented by a socalled modder a term used to describe those who redesign games by creating new levels and maps\n","One possible scenario is that using AI in game development will create more games but the quality will drop which means that more boring mediocre games will be released\n","On average more than 30 new games are already appearing on the Steam gaming platform every day\n","Additionally AI  which can handle all tasks of game development from graphics to copywriting to programming  makes it much easier for everyone to develop a game\n","This means that more usergenerated content could emerge in the coming years which may also create new successful genres\n","After all the development of technology  which was initially rather limited  has always had a significant influence on game development starting with text adventures in the 1980s followed by 2D platforms with pixel graphics in the 1990s then detailed openworld games in the 2000s and now popular multiplayer online games which bring together dozens of players at the same time\n","This article was originally written in German\n","\n","\n","'*** How Louis Armstrong left his mark in East Germany in 1965 18.09.2023 ****'\n","In March 1965 Louis Armstrong came to East Germany for a series of concerts It was a tightly packed tour The jazz superstar performed 17 shows in nine days in five different cities of the communist German Democratic Republic GDR\n","Around 45000 East Germans saw him play live with his All Stars band\n","The political background behind Armstrongs concert series turned it into an event that was both outstanding and ambivalent said Paola Malavassi cocurator of a new exhibition that takes the historic event as a starting point Ive Seen the Wall  Louis Armstrong on Tour in the GDR 1965 is now on show at Das Minsk an art museum in the former East German city of Potsdam right outside Berlin\n","The Berlin Wall had been built less than four years earlier by the GDR the satellite state of the Soviet Union was aiming to stop the brain drain of educated and skilled workers from the East to the West\n","Amid Cold War propaganda the GDRs ruling Socialist Unity Party increasingly hardened its stance toward popular music throughout the 1950s and 1960s By the end of 1965 during its plenary session the party officially unveiled its hard line against all cultural manifestations that were deemed to promote the Wests nihilistic and pornographic values\n","Jazz was also viewed suspiciously GDR leader Walter Ulbricht is said to have described it as the ape music of imperialism\n","But the GDR authorities attitude toward the music genre also fluctuated from the 1950s to the 1970s with some officials recognizing its power as the peoples music because of its African American roots \n","Satchmo as Armstrong was nicknamed had been invited by the Deutsche Knstler Agentur the GDR state agency in charge of determining which foreign musicians could perform in East Germany as well as which East German artists were allowed to play abroad\n","Politicallytoned speeches were held upon Armstrongs arrival in Berlin The head of the GDR artists agency Ernst Zielke praised the musicians visit as a symbol of peace and socialism calling it a celebration of the working class and friendship between peoples\n","On the other hand the United States was also keen to send jazz musicians to Soviet countries as goodwill ambassadors\n","The GDR had allowed the Armstrong concerts to take place in halls with a capacity of 2000 to 3000 seats but it had also assigned the Stasi East Germanys secret police to surveil the concertgoers fearing riots\n","The tour is remembered as having given a boost to the East German jazz scene with the music genre serving as a symbol of freedom as noted by jazz musician Jason Moran cocurator of Ive Seen the Wall in a podcast released as part of the exhibition\n","The title of the exhibition refers to a statement made by Armstrong at a press conference in East Berlin during the tour\n","A West German journalist asked him to comment on the Berlin Wall dividing the city In his answer Armstrong avoided the political debate Ive seen the Wall  and Im not worried about the Wall  Im worried about the audience Im going to play to tomorrow night\n","However he then added I cant say what I want to say but if youll accept it forget about all that other bullst\n","The interpreter nervously chuckled and did not translate Armstrongs reference to selfcensorship into German simply mentioning the singers use of a strong expression along with his call to concentrate on the music   \n","Zielke the director of the GDRs artists agency promptly closed the topic at the press conference by stating Anyhow its interesting that the only political question of this kind is not from us but from a Western outlet We are delighted to note this\n","Just as interestingly even though they didnt refer to the GDRs state of affairs all previous questions by East German journalists were equally political\n","They were rather interested in finding out Armstrongs stance toward the civil rights movement Just as the influential trumpet player was touring East Germany the Selma to Montgomery marches were taking place in the US The nonviolent protests held to demonstrate against the racial repression of African Americans had Martin Luther King Jr as their figurehead\n","A few months previously in September 1964 King had given speeches in West and East Berlin In both parts of the divided city he advocated reconciliation the pastor and social activist also compared the divisions between African Americans and white people in the US and those between Germans living in communist and democratic systems\n","Kings emphasis on their common struggles was particularly moving for East Berliners  but made US officials nervous The GDR and the Soviet Union often highlighted how racial violence in the US was a sign of the failure of the American society East Germans were strong supporters of the civil rights movement \n","Asked about the marches Armstrong explained that his contribution to the movement was rather to play everywhere in his home country and to build connections with his white fans even in the racially segregated South I just do my little part which some of them the activists dont do But I do he said at the East Berlin press conference\n","By then Satchmo was somewhat embittered of being accused by fellow Black Americans of not doing enough for the civil rights movement Though the jazz icon mainly avoided politics he did famously criticize the governments lack of action in the Little Rock Nine case in 1957 when nine Black students enrolled at a formerly allwhite school in Arkansas faced horrendous treatment by those who were protesting against desegregation\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Many African American activists had maligned the jazz superstar for not being vocal enough but as cocurator Moran noted they came back over time and said Well actually Louis was most profound in his activism They had by then realized that there are different ways people could manage to get in the room to spark change\n","And for Moran thats what Armstrong did As one of the first Black superstars in the US and internationally Armstrong found his way inside rooms in a way that the person on the street doesnt And they do need each other as a community of activists to spark a kind of change possible change\n","Ive Seen the

15.09.2023 ****\"\n","Operatic productions have long been known to tackle complex themes of historical significance  from the French Revolution to the rise and fall of dictators like Julius Cesar\n","The opera Chief Hijangua tells the story of German settlers in South West Africa in what is presentday Namibia This dark chapter of Germanys history has recently been the subject of films art exhibitions and other theatrical works and now the first opera written by a Namibian composer will touch on this complicated history and what it means for the present relationship between the two countries\n","Presented on September 15 16 and 17 in Berlins Haus des Rundfunks the opera brings together performers from Namibia South Africa and Germany under the leadership of conductor and composer Eslon Hindundu who leads the Rundfunk Symfonie Orchester Berlin as well as Berlins Cantus Domus Chor and Vox Vitae Musica which is dedicated to Namibian choral music\n","Chief Hijangua premiered in the Namibian capital of Windhoek in September of 2022 this will mark its European debut\n","Presentday Namibia named at the time German South West Africa became a German colony in 1884 despite the land being long inhabited by the Herero and Nama people\n","In 1904 the Herero people rose up against German colonial rule and German military commander General Lothar von Trotha issued a notorious extermination order which led to what has gone down in the history books as the one of the earliest and biggestgenocides of the 20th century \n","The opera Chief Hijangua is set in an imaginary world that resembles the late 19th century and the landscape is similar to that of Namibia It tells the story of Chief Hijanguas journey to find himself and how he encounters the German settlers Yet Chief Hijangua does not directly tell the story of the genocide explains the operas codirector Michael Pulse\n","Were trying to avoid this idea that this story is based on somebody who has lived before which is not the case It is mirroring some of these events that have happened but we do not tie it directly to the history of Namibia and Germany and the genocide because it is set in a time period before that  when the German settlers arrived and these two cultures the Germans and the Herero met for the first time Pulse tells DW In this sense the opera is meant as a prequel to the horrors of the genocide on Namibian soil he says\n","In the Afrofuturistic world in which this opera is set Germans and Namibians are united explained Pauls \n","Performers were not cast based on nationality The Germans and the Namibians are playing the villagers and the Germans and the Namibians are playing the settlers Pulse and the team wanted to challenge the audience and test how they would view casting not based on skin color or nationality Our major is Black our pastor is Black we have white soldiers we have Black soldiers So how do you feel when you look at this Do you see the story or do you see color or race asks Pulse of the audience\n","After all the themes dealt with by both groups represented in the opera the German settlers and the Herero people  are the same The story in both of these spaces deals with themes of power jealousy greed  the fact that women dont have that much control over who they marry what they say what they wear explains Pulse So are you seeing those things before you see race\n","\n","Musically speaking the work fuses classical Western music with African music and features improvisation  an element lacking in the standard classical canon This pays homage to Namibias oral musical tradition\n","The libretto is bilingual in Otjiherero and German The operas composer Eslon Hindundu wrote in the program notes that this was was done to bring two nations together in harmony as well as to open the minds and eyes of Namibians and reflect on the journey that Namibians have taken for todays current and future generations\n","Indeed one of the operas goals is to unite Namibians through music The team including Pulse who is from Namibia and German director Kim Mira Meyer traveled the country selecting props such as woven baskets and clothing items which are used in various regions of the country  and not only by one ethnic group\n","Having the European premiere of Chief Hijangua in Berlin is packed with significance for Pulse Our history has been connecting us from the day that we met and it will still continue connecting us until the the day history evolves into something else And thats why we brought it here\n","Edited by

But the situation looks much worse outside the urban center\n","The earthquakes epicenter was in Al Haouz province in the High Atlas Mountains where entire villages were devastated with high numbers of victims\n","After a disaster like this the most important thing is to preserve human lives Eric Falt regional director of UNESCOs Office for the Maghreb told The Art Newspaper However Falt also emphasized the importance of assessing the damage and restoring tangible and intangible cultural heritage sites\n","Of course after a disaster there are more immediate needs to be met  can people still be saved is there enough food and drinking water do people have access to safe shelter But in a second phase schools and cultural assets will need to be rebuilt and plans need to begin as soon as possible the UNESCO regional director added\n","Photos on X formerly Twitter show numerous before and after pictures of buildings that were destroyed including the mosque of Tinmal in the Atlas

identity\n","Such sites are not only important for tourism Above all they are living spaces Harder said The structures that make up cultural heritage sites have been developed over centuries and have been part of the peoples everyday life as its where they live shop pray and work she added\n","When natural disasters or wars damage such sites people not only lose an important anchor but also part

Keres father wanted to offer his eldest son a better future He was the only of 13 siblings to be sent to school at the age of 7\n","That privilege however meant that he had to leave his village Far from his family he sat with more than 100 children in a dark and stuffy classroom that frequently overheated\n","Thats when he started dreaming that he would one day build better schools with natural light and better air circulation\n","Today Francis Kere is one of the worlds elite architects and a leading voice in sustainable design\n","In 2022 he became the first Black architect and the first one from the African continent to receive the prestigious Pritzker Prize  an award seen as the Nobel Prize of architecture\n","On September 12 the Japan Art Association honored him with the Praemium Imperiale for his lifes work\n","Francis Kere who was born in the small village of Gando in 1965 moved to Berlin as a young man thanks to a scholarship\n","He first completed vocational training as a carpenter in the German capital before starting to study architecture at Berlins Technical University in 1995\n","While still a student he completed his first major project building a primary school out of clay in Gando  light and airy just like the one he wished for as a child\n","For his respectful use of resources and his environmental approach he received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture

Christoph Schlingensief\n","With the construction of the elementary school in Gando Kere demonstrated how the oldest but also most ecological building material in the world can be used in a more modern and resistant way\n","Keres bricks are made of clay which has been used in the Sahel region for centuries due to its temperatureregulating properties He also makes use of laterite a soil type that has a rustyred coloration due to its high iron oxide content A little bit of cement is added to the slightly moistened earth that is pressed into bricks which makes them strong and waterproof\n","The buildings design is so clever that it does not need air conditioning to remain cool working with natural air circulation instead Kere also designs his buildings in harmony with the path of the sun integrating natural shade into his concepts\n","For a better future for all of us  not just in Africa but for all of us on this planet  it is important to go back and actually only use materials that nature freely gives us and to stop overexploiting them Kere told DW while working on one of his latest projects in Senegal the Goethe Institute in Dakar\n","Dealing with the extreme temperatures is one of Keres key concerns The roof of his building in Dakar is literally its crowning glory \n","Like the crown of a tree this structure provides shade and protection Here you can meet or simply relax he said at the presentation of the building project\n","Whether in Dakar or in Benin where he is currently building the new parliament building Keres approach follows traditional rules and is based on a holistic concept largely involving local workers\n","Building is a big task and it requires many many people to work together people who also have a lot of experience and pass on their knowledge to the next generation said the architect That means its a community event and Ive integrated that idea into my projects\n","Remaining true to his first design the village school in Gando Kere is committed to architectural designs filled with air and light which harness the local communitys energy and convey identity and pride Of course I want to create quality and comfort But above all I want the result to inspire people he said\n","This is also the case in his current project the Parliament of the Republic of Benin which incorporates the traditional African palaver tree

Boric told DW I believe that democracy to be strengthened and to take care of itself has to know how to respond  to the needs of our citizens\n","\n","Boric Chiles president since March 2022 is the countrys eighth elected leader since Augusto Pinochets military rule ended in 1990 The 37yearold was born more than a decade after Pinochets violent coup ousted the Marxist president Salvador Allende on September 11 1973 but like many Chileans he too has had to grapple with its aftermath\n","In an exclusive interview with DWs Jenny Perez to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1973 coup Boric spoke of the current role of the armed forces the challenges faced by his government and the changes he himself has undergone since he was elected\n","Taking office as president of Chile means you have to adapt when it comes to certain things You are ruling over an entire country and therefore you represent the whole of Chilean society those who voted for you and those who didnt said Boric who is also the leader of Chiles leftwing Social Convergence Party\n","But my longing for social justice for social transformation for progress toward a fairer distribution of wealth toward a total end to discrimination against women and sexual diversity toward a development that is just and integral remains intact he said adding that he remained a person with leftwing convictions\n","These political positions and the fact that Boric is Chiles most progressive head of state in the past 50 years have influenced the commemorative events around the anniversary of the coup and Allendes death on September 11 1973\n","Boric said that given the chance he would thank the president Allende for his commitment courage and sacrifice\n","I would tell him that we are working hard to follow in his footsteps hoping to continue opening great avenues again where free men and women can walk together to build a better society\n","Boric said citing from the last speech Allende ever made on the day he died\n","It remains unclear to this day whether Allendes death was suicide or murder\n","The repercussions of Pinochets dictatorship still divide much of Chilean society Boric had campaigned for a bigger event marking the anniversary of the 1973 coup but according to a survey by pollster Pulso Ciudadano at least 60 of Chileans were not interested \n","A Pact for Peace an effort introduced by Borics predecessor to resolve the social and political conflict that has triggered countrywide protests since 2019 was also divisive During his presidency Boric has attempted to improve coexistence through minimum agreements of democratic respect including the rewriting of the constitution but the countrys rightwing and centerright parties have not supported his efforts He has championed the idea of a Pact for Democracy\n","We continue to have differences as to why this institutional breakdown is taking place and I see with concern that there are many rightwing leaders who insist on the idea that without Allende there would have been no Pinochet said Boric When you think about what that means it is very worrying It means that should there be another constitutional government they do not like and a climate of polarization and political difficulties then the answer is a coup detat and a dictatorship\n","I hope Chilean society agrees with me when I say that we will always solve the problems of democracy with more democracy and not less And that nothing will ever justify violating the human rights of those who think differently he said\n","Boric believes its a positive development that all of Chiles living expresidents including the centerright Sebastian Pinera have signed the Pact for Democracy\n","When asked about Chilean society taking a possible ultraconservative turn and the increase in more radical visions from all sectors Boric told DW he was worried He stressed the need for the government to respond to the needs of our citizens\n","In Chile we have been waiting 10 years for a pension reform Not only do pensions not go up but the trust Chileans have in democracy as a mechanism for solving their problems is weakened he said\n","Democracy from my point of view is an end in itself and we have to be looking after it constantly watering it caring for it he said adding that it was based on consensus\n","The art of politics the art of fair policies is to reach agreements among those who think differently for the sake of a shared common good And when societies become polarized that shared common good can seem distant\n","However Boric said he did not believe there was a danger of the events of September 1973 being repeated in Chile It would be irresponsible of me to say so he pointed out\n","He also highlighted recent policy achievements such as mining royalties or reducing the work week to 40 hours as examples of how Chilean democracy can function\n","I believe that the opposition is playing a role which has indeed resulted in a blockage to certain reforms but it is part of how democracy works and it is up to us to seek and explore new ways of reaching agreements he said\n","And the role of the military Now I am certain that the armed forces are not looking to engage in any kind of adventure and that they are steadfast constitutionalists and respectful of the constitution and the rule of law Boric stated\n","The Chilean presidents confidence lies in the strength of the countrys institutions but he recognizes that maintaining democracy is an ongoing process\n","Chilean democracy is a democracy that is still under construction I would not say that there is a moment when democracies are fully consolidated because societies change and with change comes new challenges he said\n","The inclusion of the feminist movement in our society for example has been very organic given the way politics was understood until 10 years ago The old idea of infinite development at any cost is not only being questioned today It is seen as something that could endanger the very survival of humanity So democracies are constantly perfecting themselves\n","Referring to the fact that the Chilean dictatorship came about in the context of the Cold War which led to numerous military regimes in the region Boric pointed out that the power of arms is very meager It vanishes with time Bodies can disappear people can be murdered comrades can be tortured but the dignity of those who fell and those who fight for a free country always ends up prevailing\n","And this is valid for the history of Chile Argentina Uruguay Brazil and so many other Latin American dictatorships  or the world he warned\n","Since his presidency began in 2022 Boric has also stood out on the international stage for his condemnation of leftist dictatorships in the region In this regard the president said he wasnt afraid of criticism\n","I am convinced that in terms of human rights we must have a single standard both from the historical point of view and from a whole of society point of view and therefore we cannot go around choosing which autocracies we like and which we dont like he said\n","If we value and defend democracy and in particular the universal respect for human rights as an advance of humanity we have to defend it from the left center and right whether we are red or blue And I will stay firm on this no matter who it bothers\n","Boric also spoke in favor of the recent gesture by the United States to declassify documents outlining the role of the world power in the 1973 coup\n","The US ambassador to Chile has been very open to it Some documents have already been declassified and I believe that the position of the United States today is clear when it comes to condemning what happened he said\n","However we can always do more The Nixon administration at the time made every possible effort  and this is all documented  first to prevent President Allende from taking office and then to hinder and create the conditions of chaos that allowed for the coup\n","US President Richard Nixons administration was heavily involved in the events leading up to the coup in Chile with the CIA helping to finance opposition efforts to organize strikes by truck drivers and shop owners The US also backed Pinochets government despite his regimes human rights record\n","Boric said that he would ask for information on the alleged collaboration of the West German intelligence service with the Pinochet dictatorship and the German sect Colonia Dignidad which cooperated with the regime\n","I have talked about this with Chancellor Olaf Scholz the few times I have met him From what I have seen I think he is keen to collaborate in everything related to the investigation and recognition of what happened in Colonia Dignidad said Boric\n","There has been an agreement to install plaques in memory of the victims of the German sect although there have been no significant advances on that front Boric said that just a bit of willpower is needed for that\n","What is clear to us is that there are still many dark elements around even 50 years after the breakdown of democracy in Chile Therefore we will continue to fight for truth and justice \n","This article was originally written in Spanish\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'*** Saudi Arabia: Will football stars have a political impact? 10.09.2023

the football we all know and love\n","But could football also make life for Saudi Arabias autocratic government more difficult After all the increased international scrutiny that comes with such high

sports was intended to limit soccers potential as a venue for antigovernment protests Dorsey a senior fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and the author of the syndicated newsletter The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer wrote in an August column\n","There are plenty of historical examples of how football can be politically troublesome in the region\n","In 1958 during the Algerian campaign for independence from colonial power France some of the best Algerian players caused controversy by defecting from the French football league to form their own independent national team\n","In 2000 Libyan football fans stormed the pitch in Benghazi after an unfair game against a club owned by the son of dictator Moammar Gadhafi\n","In 2011 hard core football fans in Egypt known as ultras played a significant role in the revolution that eventually toppled the countrys longstanding dictator Hosni Mubarak And most recently Qatar changed its own labor laws after international criticism before and during the 2022 football World Cup which it hosted\n","Despite such examples the advisory to steer clear of team sports seems to have been ditched after 2018 when Saudi Arabias ambitious Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented his hold on power\n","The Saudi government now says its focus on football is about economic diversification locals health  over 60 of Saudi nationals are obese or overweight  and developing sporting infrastructure Human rights activists disagree arguing its about sportswashing the practice of using sports events as a way of distracting from such things as a countrys repressive politics\n","The answer most likely lies somewhere in the middle The Saudi sports strategy is motivated by both internal and external political considerations\n","Around twothirds of the Saudi population is under 35 and football is the countrys favorite sport So I think that he Mohammed bin Salman realized you cant really build a sports sector without football Dorsey suggested He has to deliver on jobs and economic sustainability and sports is part of that There are also noneconomic factors he continued\n","To reduce the risk of challenges  most autocrats rely on a combination of repression legitimation and cooptation the authors of a 2022 paper International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies published in the American Political Science Review explained\n","So theyre using football for both legitimacy and to some degree cooptation purposes Adam Scharpf one of the studys authors and an assistant professor of political science at the University of Copenhagen told DW \n","Having the world best footballers playing in the countrys own league impresses citizens and demonstrates that the country can play as an equal on the world stage Scharpf said Of course you also have repression And this is all combined in a strategic way\n","Its something of a bread and circuses situation both Dorsey and Scharpf agreed referring to the ancient Roman adage that basically says when citizens are entertained and well fed they wont bother with politics\n","Essentially what the government is now doing is saying Well if you want Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi well give them to you Simon Chadwick a professor at the Skema business school in France who specializes in the links between sports and politics told The Athletic a sports publication in June But the flip side to that is they do not want to be questioned So far this year there have been more arrests of people in Saudi Arabia for posting negative comments about the government than ever before The contract is that you can have whatever you want but dont question us\n","After looking in detail at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina Scharpf and other researchers concluded that autocratic regimes are well aware of the doubleedged nature of large sporting events and deliberately devise strategies to deal with those These may include increased violence before and after an event and increased surveillance \n","So in many ways the sports event doesnt make things better for people living in the country it makes them worse Scharpf said\n","In fact despite all of the optimism about sports being a catalyst for positive social change football is just a tool Dorsey argued Whether or not it brings change depends on circumstances and how political leaders choose to use it\n","In 2011 when football fans played a major role in Egypt there were several preexisting conditions he explained You had widespread discontent and the stadium was one of the few places where that discontent could be voiced and where people had a sense of strength and numbers Are those circumstances theoretically possible in Saudi Arabia Sure Is there any indication thats a realistic scenario anytime soon Absolutely not\n","Of course football might still play a positive role at a personal or societal level However when it comes to nationwide politics neither Scharpf nor Dorsey think football is about to have any impact in Saudi Arabia In fact as Scharpf pointed out he doesnt know of any robust scientific studies anywhere that show sport helps bring about political change at the top\n","A brief search using Google offers another albeit pretty unscientific answer as to whether the Saudi strategy on football is succeeding at an international level\n","A daterestricted search turns up around 10 Englishlanguage news headlines about Mohammed alGhamdi the retired Saudi teacher recently sentenced to death for posting political opinions on X

the 1980s when culturally vibrant tenement streets were due to be flattened in the Kreuzberg district in the former West Berlin\n","\n","But while 1950sera urban planning designed to create car cities

disappeared from there when the Berlin Wallfell in 1989\n","It wasnt until 2013 that the Berlin police received a photo that gave reason to suspect the horses might still exist Along with the

04.09.2023 ****'\n","Historically art in Pakistan has found unique ways to comment on social issues and push boundaries However much like in other countries the art market is heavily curated and often the domain of the countrys privileged elite is skewed toward certain themes styles aesthetics and formal training\n","The Pakistan Art Forum PAF established in 2014 aims to circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of art in the country\n","It first used social media and digital platforms to feature more eclectic and inclusive artists and styles After the pandemic the forum also set up a physical address that serves as a safe space for artists allowing them to push boundaries and start a dialogue about queer and LGBTQ identity politics sexuality and power all while challenging patriarchy  themes that are taboo in Pakistan\n","Throughout the ages art has been a medium of reform resistance used to highlight various social dilemmas Imtisal Zafar founder of PAF tells DW It is important for us to not only curate shows that are aesthetically appealing but also to use art as a medium to shed light on various issues \n","Human rights violations and atrocities against women in Pakistan have gained more visibility through social media and reports and the situation is being increasingly denounced by artists challenging the countrys patriarchal social system Many of them have adopted a decidedly feminist stance\n","Most notably Shehzil Malik has gained international renown for her depictions of powerful Pakistani women and femininity Her works deal with the everyday and structural misogyny faced by women\n","While Maliks portrayals of feminine strength are almost otherworldly fantastical and supernatural Zainab Aziz is a young emerging artist showing feminine strength in another creative way by focusing on the mundane\n","Aziz works primarily with oil paints and has a signature style featuring a monochromatic palette and large voids in her representations Through blackandwhite contrasts she aims to highlight social hypocrisy\n","My work revolves around female protagonists the way they share their secrets and bond I consider the female body as a landscape of a society which bears multiple stories within it says Aziz\n","Three pieces from her second solo show Misty Tales of Women document everyday habitual moments of womens lives depicting how they are expected to trust their surroundings and what society demands of them blindly\n","Aziz who has received training from Pakistans College of Art  Design and the National College of Arts recognizes that the institutions have allowed her to polish her artistry Still she laments the lack of connections for young and emerging artists to break through\n","I have faced a lot of difficulties as a Pakistani artist as we dont get the exposure we deserve domestically or internationally One has to struggle by themselves to make their name in the art world says Aziz\n","She points out that the Pakistan Art Forum is the only platform in the country that supports emerging and young talents According to Aziz PAFs unique proposition is that they help relatively new artists sell their work immediately by encouraging supporting and guiding them to showcase their work in galleries and helping them get media exposure \n","The founder of PAF Imtisal Zafar explains that his mission is to support artists with a diverse portfolio He routinely visits university art shows of graduating students to discover new talent He first met Aziz at her thesis show in 2017\n","Samesex sexual acts are banned by Pakistani law Sodomy is a crime that can be punished with two years to a life sentence in prison\n","Understandably many LGBTQ people in the country lead double lives and engage in clandestine affairs keeping their sexual identity a secret from their closest friends and family\n","Ahmer Farooq boldly tackles LGBTQ issues in his art shedding light on how gays are pressured into forced heterosexual marriages to uphold a faade of normalcy \n","He explains that a gallery refused to show his work under his concept which described how the art deals with gay forced marriages I then changed the statement to edit out gay and was allowed to show it The same art the same everything but I had to realign my concept Farooq tells DW\n","He says that the press also often refuses to share his art and cover his shows fearing backlash or legal consequences as even openly discussing homosexuality can get one into trouble\n","Farooq is grateful that PAF has never censored his art showcasing his work without prejudice or modifying his concept\n","The artists unique style features vibrant colors to translate the hypocrisy of a sanctimonious society visually It all looks bright and cheerful on the surface but it is much darker if you look closer Farooq points out\n","His recent show A Safe Space has drawn considerable local and international interest and Farooq will show his work in the US soon\n","The artist feels safe spaces are essential to many peoples survival as marginalized people need a bubble to be themselves\n","While his show shines a light on the challenges faced by the queer community Farooq states that his work also comments on how we are all bound together in our humanity and simply want the same things security love peace and empathy\n","Edited by Elizabeth

studies at Sapir College in Sderot a city in southern Israel which has been since 2001 the target of repeated missile attacks by Palestinian militants due to its proximity to the Gaza strip \n","Graizer found living in the war zone exhausting for more than one reason Not just from running away from missiles but also dealing with aspects of nationalism and violence from the Israeli side \n","What he discovered in the German capital was completely different Berlin was vibrant fun young fascinating It was nice to have some kind of calm life it was a relaxed place So I ended up staying\n","Many Israelis are moving to Berlin to find peace  a striking twist of fate knowing that some 90 years ago Germany was a lifethreatening country for Jews \n","Among his very small experiences of antisemitism in Germany Graizer recalls passing by a group of teenagers listening to Nazi music and giving him nasty looks \n","But he rather describes other incidents he experienced such as the harsh reaction of a law enforcement agent after hearing the Israelis accent as being more antiforeigner than antisemitic I dont think anyone can look at me and say Oh youre Jewish But my accent and appearance are obviously not white German he explains\n","For the filmmaker antisemitism and hatred against foreigners exist everywhere in the world and Germany is no exception But he nevertheless sees the country as being at the forefront in promoting human rights artistic freedom education and arts Its good to be a part of it he adds\n","Today Germany is one of the safest places in the world for Jews says Graizer laughing lightly Im saying this with humor but I feel much safer here as a gay leftist\n","The 42yearold filmmaker grew up in Raanana an affluent city in central Israel with a considerable modern Orthodox community\n","With his father being religious and his mother secular Graizer went to a secular school but was brought up religiously We were kind of strict we had to eat kosher and we wouldnt take the car on Shabbat recalls Graizer It created a lot of conflict I hated it especially when I was a teenager\n","Graizer came out as gay at the age of 16 It was not an easy journey it took some years But now my parents accept it A lot of people become softer when they grow older says the director\n","Graizer is best known for his feature debut film The Cakemaker 2017 which won the Ecumenical Jury prize following its premiere at the Karlovy Vary film festival along with seven Ophir Awards  Israels version of the Oscars  and numerous other prizes in festivals worldwide It was Israels official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars in 2019 \n","Still success did not come easily for Graizer It took him eight years to make The Cakemaker After being rejected by 19 film funds he managed to make the film on a shoestring budget of 90000 82000\n","With the success of his first film Graizer secured funding for his second film more easily but this time he was faced with new challenges America was shot in 2020 during the early stages of the pandemic\n","He struggled to film under lockdowns and the entire cinema industry was unsettled by the pandemic rules America is a film made for the big screen All the theaters and cinemas were shut down and we didnt even know if we would ever be able to show it recalls the director\n","But Graizer kept pushing forward Every movie has its journey You need thick skin finding the people who believe in what you do and not to take things personally \n","America tells the story of an Israeli swim coach who returns from the US to Israel after his fathers death Tragic circumstances lead to a complex relationship with his best friends fiance a florist\n","The Israeli German and Czech coproduction premiered at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and won the best actress award at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 2022\n","Graizers film which will be released in Germany in 2024 is now being screened at the Israeli film festival Seret International held in Berlin Hamburg and Cologne from September 311 2023\n","The Israeli newspaper Haaretz compared America to Pedro Almodovar films as it features bold colors and a melodramatic plot though Graizers work is more restrained and quiet than the Spanish filmmakers typically exuberant movies\n","Other critics have compared Graizer to German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder Its an honor but I never say that my work is like this or that I do things the way I imagine them from my subconscious Im influenced not just by drama or melodrama but also mafia horror and espionage films explains the director\n","There are many similarities between America and The Cakemaker which is also a romantic melodrama with a love triangle driven by grief\n","In The Cakemaker a young gay German baker loses his Israeli lover in a car accident Shortly after he travels to Jerusalem and gets a job at a caf owned by his lovers widow A tender relationship develops between the two until his identity is eventually revealed\n","Certain aspects of Graizers personal life are echoed in his films For example his husband a German the filmmaker met three years after moving to Berlin is a production designer and florist and he is the one who designed the lush flower shop and flower arrangements in Graizers latest film\n","Graizers second passion is cooking He has worked as a cook in restaurants as a private chef and as a cooking instructor in Berlin hot spots such as Goldhahn and Sampson where he taught participants how to cook Israeli vegetarian dishes\n","Through those workshops he has developed certain observations on the Germans palate The average German eater likes to try new things but is scared of tastes that are too strong or too bold he points out \n","But once you show them how to do it they fall in love with it he adds A lot of people were shocked to find out how amazing roasted eggplant can be or roasting pine nuts which brings out all their flavor Small things that anyone can do in their own kitchen adds the foodie who has also published a book of recipes and family stories about food Ofirs Kche Ofirs Kitchen which came out in 2018\n","Asked about his most notable culture shock experiences in Germany the first thing that comes to his mind is also foodrelated The taste of cucumbers and tomatoes he humorously complains  a deception certainly shared by many Mediterraneans who are used to produce that ripens on the plants But its getting better he adds\n","Otherwise he notes that he is still troubled by the discrepancies between the clichs about his adoptive country and how things actually work We have this stereotype that in Germany everything is planned and on time but then it takes 20 years to build an airport and the train never arrives on time\n","Then perhaps in an attempt to show that German quirks are not the only ones to drive him mad he quickly adds that many other things drive him even more crazy such as in Israel sitting in a bus across a soldier with an M16 aimed at your crotch\n","America will be screened on Sunday September 9 at 630 pm at

construction The court architect Heinrich Strack was responsible for the planning and construction of this National Monument to the Wars of Unification the figure of Victoria with laurel wreath and Prussian eagle on the helmet was created by the sculptor Friedrich Drake\n","After the wars against Denmark 1864 Austria 1866 and France 1870 which were called the Wars of German Unification Wilhelm I already King of Prussia since 1861 was proclaimed head of the German Empire in Versailles in 1871\n","Wilhelm had already commissioned the construction of the Victory Column after the victory over Denmark in 1864\n","The day of its unveiling marked the third anniversary of the French surrender  Sedan Day\n","The Battle of Sedan took place during the FrancoPrussian War from September 12 1870 which resulted in the capture of Emperor Napoleon II and his thousands of troops effectively deciding the war in favor of Prussia\n","At the time of its construction the Victory Column stood about one and a half kilometers about a mile away from its current location on Knigsplatz now Platz der Republik\n","It was erected on Siegesallee in front of the Raczynski Palace that housed the art collection of the Polish count and diplomat Atanazy Raczynski The building was designed by the Victory Column architect Heinrich Strack The palace was ultimately demolished and beginning in the mid1880s the new Reichstag building was erected and completed in 1894\n","The Victory Column stood in the way of the plans of Nazi architect Albert Speer For the World Capital Germania envisioned by the National Socialists a huge congress hall was to be built in its place\n","So in 1939 Viktoria  who crowns the Victory Column  had to move to her present location at the Grosser Stern in the Tiergarten There the column was enlarged by another drum from just under 60 to now around 67 meters 197 to 220 feet\n","Gilded cannon barrels that were taken from war booty relief depictions symbolizing the grandeur and superiority of the Empire and a goddess of victory that even the Nazis knew how to appropriate no wonder the demolition of the Victory Column was up for debate after World War II Polish soldiers unaware of its significance later regretted not having blown up the monument The French occupation forces did request the demolition of the Victory Column but the Americans and British voted against it while the Soviet Union abstained\n","Berliners quickly disbanded with the historical symbolism of the Victory Column taking away a bit of the grandeur of the goddess of victory by giving it the nickname Goldelse the equivalent of Golden Lizzy which still persists in the vernacular\n","Today the monument is particularly popular with tourists\n","But thats no wonder as the platform at a height of 51 meters offers an impressive panoramic view of the city Along the Strasse des 17 Juni Boulevard of June 17 one looks toward the Brandenburg Gate which also showcases an image of Victoria looking toward the east\n","In 1987 German film director Wim Wenders sent Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander as guardian angels into the heaven over Berlin in the film Wings of Desire The Victory Column plays a central role from which actor Bruno Ganz as the angel Damiel looks down on the then still divided city  and wants to throw himself down to become an earthly being\n","Once the Berlin Wall collapsed Wenders followed his film up with a sequel in 1993 In weiter Ferne so nah Faraway So Close\n","Since the mid1990s the Goldelse has been in the midst of the hustle and bustle once a year the Love

the IAA wants to be seen as a showcase of urban mobility exhibiting mobility ecosystems and not merely a single mode of transportation the automobile The marketing pitch sounds like an excuse for the absence of many foreign automakers in Munich this year indeed more bicycle manufacturers are set to attend whatever that says about the new IAAs appeal\n","Quite naturally the big three of the German automobile industry  Volkswagen VW BMW and MercedesBenz  have a vested interest in holding the event in their home market But the list of globally known brands represented in Munich is shorter than

with significantly lower prices for their cars\n","There is precedence In the 1980s and 1990s carmakers from Japan and South Korea were initially laughed at for their cars but they then steadily increased their market share through lower prices and better quality\n","\n","Despite the shortage of big names at this years IAA exhibition halls are 90 booked according to the VDA industry group IAAs design concept has been changed and now includes two separate locations  the main exhibition center for professional visitors and a socalled Open Space in downtown Munich for the general

visitors to Amsterdam who have taken a canal trip will be familiar with the building Its a beautiful palace right on the River Amstel a brick building with a striking white portal that was built in the 17th century as Diaconie Oude Vrouwen Huys or Nursing Home for Old Women\n","In the early 2000s the building was rededicated as an institution for the arts With support from the Dutch a branch of the Saint Petersburg Hermitage called Hermitage Amsterdam was established here\n","The elaborate renovation which is said to have cost over 40 million 43 million was financed by Russia officially a private foundation registered in the United Kingdom at the time was behind the project\n","Incidentally this was not the first attempt by the famous Saint Petersburg museum to establish some sort of permanent representation in the West There was already a branch in London from 2000 to 2007 and in Las Vegas from 2001 to 2008\n","In 2009 Hermitage Amsterdam was officially opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Russias then interim president Dmitry Medvedev\n","In the following years more than a dozen lavishly staged exhibitions were held there filled with pieces from the immense depots of Russias Hermitage With more than 3 million items the museum is one of the largest and richest in the world\n","Private treasures of the Russian tsars antique gold Persian miniatures and masterpieces by Caspar David Friedrich from the Russian collections were presented in Amsterdam  to name just a few highprofile projects\n","Over 700000 visitors saw the opening show Numbers then leveled off at around 450000 visitors per year This put the museum securely in fifth place in the ranking of art museums in the tourist mecca of Amsterdam overtaken only by the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Stedelijk and Amsterdam museums respectively Admission costs 10 on average so the investment certainly paid off even after deducting all incidental costs\n","Of course the business model of a museum empire with exhibitions that move from one branch to another is not new The Louvre in Paris for example operates a successful branch in Abu Dhabi and the Guggenheim museums are also a globally operating consortium\n","On February 24 2022  the day Russia launched its fullscale invasion of Ukraine  the Hermitage was showing an exhibition of the socalled Russian avantgarde which had opened

as well as 23 pieces of the traveling exhibition Grand Tour Dream of Italy from Venice to Pompeii\n","The return transport of the famous Mozorov Collection from a Paris exhibition to various Russian museums also proved to be a major logistical and diplomatic problem especially since some of the works also came from Ukrainian holdings\n","While Russias Hermitage staff was dealing with all of this the Amsterdam branch was abandoned But in a show of creative solidarity the other art houses in Amsterdam came to its aid Together they developed the idea of a Dutch Heritage museum as a transitional model\n","First the neighboring Rijksmuseum loaned one of its iconic works Vermeers Milkmaid An exhibition on the history of the painting and the Delft painters craft was arranged around the

artworks from 19 different countries\n","The exhibition explores how surrealism can contribute to giving visibility to traumatized identities and bodies as well as wounded landscapes as the exhibitions accompanying text puts it\n","In other words Surreal Futures deals with nothing less than the major issues of our time including climate change environmental destruction identity colonialism and racism reflecting artistic confrontations with these issues in a rapidly changing world\n","The show curated by Patrick Blmel is divided into three thematic chapters Digital Bodies Transforming Landscapes and Future Worlds \n","It is the museums first exhibition with a digital focus and it includes digital collages generated by 3D software virtual reaIity and digital tools\n","Works by GhanaianMoroccan artist David Alabo are also prominently featured in the show\n","Alabo has been exploring many of the aforementioned themes in a multidisciplinary way for years and is one of the wellknown representatives of Afrofuturism a worldwide aesthetic movement that encompasses art literature music film and science and that is created by African authors mostly in the diaspora\n","DW met David Alabo for a conversation on August 28 after the exhibition opening\n","DW What is your personal definition of Afrofuturism\n","David Alabo I love that question I define Afrofuturism as a reimagination or reinterpretation of both futures and pasts that may have not existed or may have existed and there is a sense of hope or optimism you can get when youre imagining a future that you know isnt based necessarily on reality\n","As an Afrofuturist the main idea or driving force behind my work is to create a sense of optimism hope and empowerment for people that see the work African art has most of the time been quite drenched in pain and suffering based on the history of colonialism and slavery and a lot of these really real and serious topics\n","And I think the job of an Afrofuturist specifically is to ask questions about how could we see our people How could we see Black people How could we see African people How could we see people in the diaspora Thriving in places that are imagined or surreal\n","But I also like to have my art piece almost like a canvas for peoples thoughts and expressions and for them to find some sense of healing through the art\n","So surrealism as healing instead of an escape into a dream world\n","Im not trying to remove the Black experience or my experience from reality but I feel like when you look at the art and you meditate on it and you heal on it its a reflection of your reality seen through a different lens or seen through a different perspective which I think is so important because a lot of the times we need a sense of healing hope and optimism because we do live in a world thats quite cynical quite dystopian Were always hearing news about the worlds going to end\n","So in a way theres a fine line between creating a world that isnt based on reality but at the same time allows people that experience my art or other Afrofuturist art to draw some sort of lessons to the world and bring and relate it back to their own existence\n","You speak of a past that might have been So an imaginary past that we could strive for in the present\n","I like to take the real symbols of Black power Black resilience like those common motifs of the raised fist the Black Panther and also Black people But I recontextualize them by putting them in new spaces in new worlds that gives them a new meaning Otherwise I feel like the art would be a little too abstract\n","When I create objects or sculptures theyre not necessarily based on things that Ive seen before in my life\n","I think I was drawn to surrealism because it allows me to tap into the subconscious the unconscious and things that kind of pop up in my head Art has been a great way for me to make sense of my own life and experiences and I hope that thats what is transmitted through it when you see it\n","There is indeed a renaissance of surrealism \n","It seems like the more we get into this techdriven world where were being fed so much information about our reality we want to see things that maybe dont exist\n","I am using a lot of software and a lot of technology and at the same time I am conscious of the fact that the people behind the technologies Im using might not necessarily be Black or African So I think its important as well for the Afrofuturist to ask questions about who is in charge of the technology or the structures that a lot of artists use\n","In a way its as much about me consuming technology as it is about questioning it or trying to build So I know the future for me is where Im very much involved not only in the consumption of technology but also in its creation and development as a way to have more representation and a more equal amount of voices represented\n","In the field of digital art AI is also becoming an increasingly important topic Where do you see the advantages and disadvantages of this technology\n","We have models and programs that can turn out art on an incredible level and speed that is almost impossible for us to replicate as humans But my point is that we should not be blinded by ignorance or to be afraid of it I think that its important for us artists to learn more about it  it doesnt mean you have to use it  but you can learn more about it just so you can be aware of how your place in this world might be shifting\n","Its never going to replace what makes us human\n","I use AI specifically for administrative things or for the things that take away time for me to create art whether its to answer emails or help me research something\n","It doesnt have to necessarily be directly involved in my art but it can allow me more time to be human Especially after this show when I met some of the people that use AI more directly I realized that Im just tapping the surface Theres so much I need to learn and Im not in a rush because everybodys saying Oh yes artists are gonna be done Journalists are gonna be done No thats just fear mongering\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","What is your experience of the exhibition here\n","I think its beautiful that theyve been so progressive in trying to show not only just futuristic or new media art but also art from underrepresented communities And its very brave of the museum to not only host this but to make sure that the artists are present Its just as important as the people that make it be there than just the art\n","The exhibition Surreal Futures is on show at the Max Ernst Museum in Brhl until January 28 2024\n","This interview has been edited for

the GoetheInstitut Carola Lentz presented the culturalpolitical award during a ceremony\n","This years choice of prizewinners is likely to stir controversy especially the selection of Gaga Chkheidze from the former Eastern bloc country of Georgia\n","Gaga Chkheidze until recently director of the internationally renowned Tbilisi Film Festival has fallen out of favor with the ruling Georgian Dream Party After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 he publicly criticized Georgia for not immediately distancing itself from Russia\n","That stance cost him his position as head of the Georgian National Film Center In addition he was expelled by the countrys national film funding organization the Georgian Filmfund\n","The Tbilisi Film Festivals office on the site of the old Soviet film studios was closed film grants were cancelled and the festivals budget was cut\n","Born in Georgia in 1957 Gaga Chkheidze has always been considered a friend of Germany and a cultural bridge builder and not only between those two countries\n","From 1976 to 1980 he studied in Jena in the central German state of Thringen In the 1980s he worked as the director of the German school in Tbilisi and taught German literature at the Georgian capitals Ilia State University In 1988 he organized a Georgian film retrospective at the Arsenal cinema in Berlin for which he smuggled films across the Soviet border in his car In the 1990s he was a translator and program coordinator for the International Forum of New Cinema at the Berlin International Film Festival before launching the Tbilisi International Film Festival in Georgia in 2000\n","\n","This coincided with the founding of a National Film Institute in Tbilisi which gave Georgian films a new boost The budget for film promotion was tripled movie theaters sprung up and more and more films made it to international festivals from Berlin to Toronto Georgian cinema drew attention from the European film market\n","Gaga Chkheidzes commitment to film is crucial to Georgias connection to European and international institutions and programs film markets and festivals the Goethe Medal award jury said in their citation\n","Indeed Chkheidzes festival concept appealed to both filmmakers and audiences alike Soon the Tbilisi Film Festival became an international meeting place for filmmakers\n","As director of the Georgian National

Russian invasion of Ukraine also had an impact on Georgia The Tbilisi festival came under increasing pressure as demonstrated by the firing of its director\n","Unfortunately here in Georgia we are on the front line between democracy and autocracy Chkheidze said in a recent interview with Deutschlandradio There are many signs that political development in the country is heading in the wrong

the danger is real he said\n"," \n","Analysts say Georgia is indeed teetering between Moscow and Brussels 15 years after its war with Russia the country officially has aspirations of joining the

Kobachidze emphasizes the high tourism revenue from Russians the equivalent of about 900 million 972 million every year\n","It is true that Georgias government always appears proEuropean to the outside world says Kachkachishvili But its doing nothing to set itself on a course to EU membership rather its becoming more and more proRussian\n","Two years ago the documentary film Taming the Garden painted a picture of the situation in Georgian society In it Georgian director Salome Jashi tells the story of centuriesold trees that an influential man collects for his private park \n","The man  presumably Georgias exprime minister and party leader Bidzina Ivanishvili who made his billiondollar fortune in the finance and commodities business  remains unnamed in the film Jashis theme is rather the uprooting of people in both real and metaphorical terms\n","Taming the Garden caused a sensation at film festivals around the world including the 2021 Berlin International Film Festival To this day the film is not allowed to be screened in Georgian cinemas\n","The Goethe Medal for Gaga Chkheidze arrives in the midst of this political tangle Georgias struggle for its course between Russia and the West For the proRussian camp the prestigious culturalpolitical award could be seen as an affront To proWestern factions the award will be a sign of encouragement In any case the Goethe

gems and glass dating from the 15th century BC to the 19th century AD\n","The museum was first alerted to the missing items in 2021 when it was contacted by BritishDanish art historian and dealer Ittai Gradel\n","Gradel told The Associated Press that he noticed objects for sale on eBay that had reportedly belonged to a collection donated to the museum in 1814 He said he then found the identity of the seller though PayPal who turned out to be a museum staff member who has since been fired\n","According to Gradel the museums deputy director said a thorough investigation had found no improprieties and he basically told me to sod off and mind my own business\n","In his resignation statement on Friday Fischer said the museum did not respond as comprehensively as it should have in response to the warnings in 2021 He also apologized to Gradel whom he previously implied had withheld some information\n","On Saturday Osborne attributed the museums failure to act on warnings to potential groupthink that just couldnt believe that an insider was stealing things couldnt believe that one of the members of staff were doing this\n","We believe weve been the victim of thefts over a long period of time and frankly more could have been done to prevent them he added\n","As a former Conservative finance minister under Prime Minister David Cameron and later the editor of the influential London Evening Standard newspaper Osborne is a comparatively highprofile chair of the board of trustees He was once seen as a potential successor to Cameron until the 2016 Brexit referendum results led to rapid and farreaching personnel changes in the Conservative Party\n","Londons Metropolitan Police said on Thursday that officers had interviewed a man in relation to the

Restituted sculpture of Alexander the Great — a forgery? 22.08.2023 ****'\n","Stephan Lehmann first saw the bronze sculpture of the ancient ruler in 2000 at the Winckelmann Museum in the small town of Stendal in the German state of SaxonyAnhalt The archaeologist now retired was then a professor at the university in Halle  and curious about the wellpreserved ancient work which was considered a sensation\n","The sculpture a bust of Alexander the Great was on loan from a private collector it was said For Lehmann one thing mattered was it a fake I was there I looked at it and I thought it was blatantly fake he told DW That this was an original was out of the question\n","Alexander III of Macedon born ca 356 BC commonly known as Alexander the Great was a king of Ancient Greece He spent most of his ruling years conducting an extensive military campaign throughout western Asia and Egypt By the age of 30 he had created one of the largest empires in history ranging from Greece to India\n","Lehmann searched the museum catalog for provenance information but to no avail He asked the museum pointblank but got no answers He repeated his requests unsuccessfully Museums are never amused thats clear when important pieces on display in their main hall are called into question he says\n","That did not stop the archaeologist from continuing to call the sculpture a fake Lehmann sees it as his duty to reveal the history of suspicious works He fears that a rare find from antiquity might find its way into a museum catalog and thus be academically legitimized\n","Thats why in 2015 he cataloged 36 ancient works of art that he believes to be fakes Among them was the bronze statue of Alexander the Great He also organized an exhibition on the subject at the Archaeological Museum of the University of Halle and called it Long Ago in Stendal\n","He also accused the museum of allowing itself to be misused as a laundry machine The Winckelmann Society promptly sued him for libel At the time however the court did not address the question that really interested Lehmann Is the sculpture genuine\n","But that would have been impossible because immediately after the exhibition the sculpture disappeared  it was considered lost for a long time \n","Lehmann believed it was the heist of a wellmade forgery of an international art dealer mafia To detect something like this you need decades of experience a great deal of knowledge  and intuition\n","Those skills helped Lehmann when a Swiss collector sent him the supposedly ancient bust of Emperor Augustus for examination When you look at the details you also have doubts as to whether this is really fake Its perfectly done after all Its already masterful he admitted to DW\n","He had the sculpture scanned by computer tomography Counterfeiters as the assumption goes have ancient coins melted down to cast new pieces from them Theoretically its the perfect deception because the material really is 2000 years old \n","But the depiction of Augustus did not stand up to scrutiny Some criteria such as the degree of corrosion did not line up so it could be proven that the item had been cast more recently\n","Lehmann suspects the bust is from the counterfeiting workshop of someone known as the Spanish Master who has yet to be identified Whoever this person may be they often create busts of ancient rulers and give them a beautiful patina The facial features are always very well preserved as though by magic And of course the counterfeiters create pieces that are currently in demand on the art and antiquities market\n","Regarding the value of archeological objects bronze statues are in the premiere category Theyre something very special and of course they draw the most attention says Lehmann\n","Whenever a find of this sort turns up theres no shortage of people wanting to buy it Were talking about money money and more money as the dominant factor says Oscar White Muscarella who for many years was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art He has watched dealers funnel fakes into the market like galleries and art fairs But the main gateways are auction houses according to Muscarella At some point I realized that dealers in particular but also collectors were selling their fake objects at auction he says\n","I once talked to a dealer about it and he just smiled What they do is this Instead of selling fakes in their own store they put the objects up for auction under a false name then say This ancient artifact comes from an old collection they invent a provenance a Monsieur X That way these dealers dont show up in person in front of the buyers\n","The bronze bust of Alexander the Great comes from the New York art trade from the gallery of Robin Symes The Briton is considered one of the key figures in the illegal trade in ancient objects and has since gone into hiding His company was liquidated and the art objects stored in various countries were confiscated So the bronze sculpture of Alexander the Great also found its way back to Greece as one of 351 objects identified as looted art Alexander is Number 11\n","Stephan Lehmann learned about the issue from a Greek colleague who sent him a newspaper clipping with a photo He just wrote Can this be And I looked and saw a box and packed inside was Alexander from Stendal The accompanying text said it was a piece from the art warehouse of the criminal Robin Symes in Geneva And so it reappeared  \n","Its clear the bust should not have been exhibited in Stendal without proof of origin as Lehmann had demanded in 2000 He still considers it to be a fake but is pleased that it has been found again After all it could have been melted down or be in the living room of a billionaire But to turn up as a retransfer to a state thats spectacular Lehmann thinks\n","Now he hopes the material will be investigated He assumes Athens is aware the bronze is suspected of being a forgery After all the Greek Minister of Culture herself holds a doctorate in archaeology It is now up to the Greek state to investigate the provenance of the Alexander bronze If it is genuine its worth many millions of euros Or it could be worth only 100 euros the value of its material That however would be an inglorious end for Alexander the Great\n","This article has been translated from German\n","\n","\n","\"*** 'Beyond

art is often a marketing stunt Ed Sheeran did an action painting once and Britney Spears once did some flower paintings while wearing a bikini he pointed out For Beyond Fame however he says he chose people who take art seriously\n","He says there are big surprises among them  works by German singer Tim Bendzko for example or even former tennis pro Michael Stich that have never been shown in a museum before You wouldnt think theyd paint like that None of the selected artists had ever attended an art academy he said We want to leave judgment of the works to our audience Bieber says Were excited to see the reactions\n","We cultivate Joseph Beuys expanded concept of art here explains Bieber which asserts that everyone is an artist One example he says is former Wimbledon champion Stich After retiring from tennis he took up painting as a hobby studied art history for two semesters and set up a studio Stich said it took him 10 years before he went public with his paintings My art is a reflection of my personality and my emotions as the exhibition organizers quote the former tennis pro\n","The paths the selected personalities have taken to artistic expression are as varied as the people themselves are And their choice of artistic medium is sometimes surprising Some works are closely linked to their respective biographies Some artists are at home in several creative fields at once One of them is the German theater actress author and visual artist Lea Drager She draws images of popes male and female with which she questions patriarchal systems and hierarchical structures Fellow German actress Meret Becker is active as a singer actress and visual artist Her work deals with social issues and she also campaigns for womens rights\n","Musicians like Bryan Adams and Peter Doherty have sold millions of albums  and theyve been creating visual art for many years Good photographs are like time capsules that store memories Adams told the Dsseldorf museum Doherty the scandalridden singer of British band The Libertines sees art  along with poetry  as an expressive way to process his life He works with blood and charcoal combining drawing painting sculpture and collages of images and text\n","The works by Canadian musician Claire Elise Boucher aka Grimes are populated by the kinds of fantasy figures  nymphs cyborgs and manga characters  that she also portrays herself as in her music videos According to the museum she draws inspiration for her drawings and album covers from mythical and psychedelic images borrowing figures and motifs from Art Nouveau and Surrealism and has recently begun using artificial intelligence\n","Whether as a counterbalance or a complement people in politics also engage in artistic activities For example German Green Party politician Anton Hofreiter makes no secret of his enthusiasm for\n","nature He earned a PhD in botany at the start of his political career and he paints and draws flowers For him as the museum says this is a way of recognizing how things really are\n","Beyond Fame promises to arouse curiosity about littleknown facets of prominent contemporaries Some of our artists promises curator Bieber should soon be on view in other museums For the time being the artistic director of the NRWForum is banking on the Barbie effect Whether you love Barbie or not  you simply have to have seen the latest movie\n","The exhibition Beyond Fame The Art of the Stars at the NRWForum runs until January 24 2024\n","This article has been translated from German\n","\n","\n","\"*** Germany's historical

a globe gave me my first idea of our planet even before I started school The rotating sphere my father bought was made of plastic and could light up from the inside Whether it was intended as a lamp or as an inspiration for a curious mind mattered not In any case the globe as a lamp took away my fear of the dark hallway in the evening\n","Sometimes pointing at the globe I would have my father show where we lived He would point to a spot that was not surrounded by turquoise Turquoise I already knew that much stood for the sea And where does Mother Teresa live At the time I had a burning interest in where personalities of her ilk could be found\n","But before all the countries and seas could be mapped correctly on globes the world had to be explored from the discoveries of seafarers from the 15th century to the dark side of the onset of colonization all the while as the world seemed to get ever smaller\n","Little did I know at the time that the worlds oldest globe sat right here in Germany\n","But had I seen the globe produced by Martin Behaim at the end of the 15th century I might have noticed a glaring absence The continents of the Americas and Australia are nowhere to be seen neither of which were known to central Europe at the time of its creation\n","The globe also known as the Erdapfel now resides in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg Shortly after its completion which has been dated somewhere between 1490 and 1492 the Italianborn Christopher Columbus became the first European to reach America which marked the beginning of modern globalization Australia was first reached by the British navigator James Cook and his crew in 1770\n","What you can see clearly and what is depicted very precisely is central and southern Europe the Mediterranean region and Africa The further you go away from this region the fuzzier it gets says Sonja Missfeldt press officer at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum\n","This year the globe was added to UNESCOs Memory of the World register as an outstanding testimony to how the world was imagined at the time\n","For Jan Mokre Head of Map Department and the Globe Museum of the Austrian National Library in Vienna its listing as part of humanitys documentary heritage also represents an appreciation of the efforts of museums to preserve such valuable historical objects of cultural heritage to have them professionally restored when necessary and to make them accessible to visitors\n","For Sonja Missfeldt the Behaim Globe is a pioneering work of cartography \n","It is made of various materials The sphere which is hollow on the inside is covered with painted paper A wrought iron frame holds the globe which could originally be rotated surrounded by a brass horizon ring\n","Many people were involved in its making Martin Behaim who came from a patrician family in Nuremberg had commissioned the globe It is not quite clear why It is possible that the specimen on display in the town hall at the time was intended to attract sponsors for global trade\n","Behaim was himself a traveling merchant who is said to have participated in exploratory voyages along the coast of Africa in the 1480s\n","In addition to land and water masses the globe also contains information about foreign peoples exotic animals and raw material deposits Even places where goods such as spices could be extracted have been noted\n","In addition figures reminiscent of mythical creatures are depicted Shadowfooted creatures also called sciapods are one example According to Missfeldt the depictions represent a widespread belief at the time that there were people living in more remote regions in Africa who had only one leg and a large foot that stretched upwards\n","The Behaim Globe is an object that stands as it were between the times In terms of its image it actually represents the medieval image that Europeans had of the earth and does not yet point at all to the new era explains Mokre\n","It was created at a time in which the Europeans strove for supremacy in the world by discovering unknown countries and parts of the world where raw materials were plundered and inhabitants turned into slaves before being shipped across the world\n","For the Germanisches Nationalmuseum the globe reminds us of European conquests while it is also a memorial to African slaves who played a decisive role in the creation of our modern world says Mokre\n","At the time of the Behaim Globes creation serial production was still a long way off Spherical models of our world had existed since Greek antiquity but the production of each individual globe was still a challenge for the craftsmen involved \n","People didnt have any comparable systems to draw on but started thinking about how to vividly represent the world in 3D says Sonja Missfeldt of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum\n","Today the term globe is synonymous with a model of our earth But there are also celestial globes and those of other planets and the moon\n","Between 1520 or so and 1850 it was common to make terrestrial and celestial globes as a pair to sell them as a pair and to set them up as a pair This dualism is very important because it is actually this interaction that represents the cosmos explains globe expert Jan Mokre\n","A very striking model that seeks to unite heaven and earth is the walkin Gottorf Globe from the 17th century It measures just under three meters 10 feet in diameter and shows the Earth on the outside and the sky on the inside\n","Driven by water power this famous object once made for a chamber of art and rarities could rotate once around its own axis\n","Earth and celestial globes in combination also exist in smaller form In the 18th century for example pocket globes the size of billiard balls were popular collectors items\n","From about 1850 industrial production made the globe a massproduced item\n","And the practice of keeping a globe in private living and working environments started a bit earlier says Jan Mokre who dates it to the late 18th century Among the factors that popularized ownership of the item was an improved educational situation and the fact that the economically strengthened middle classes wanted to represent themselves with knowledge Globes along with atlases and encyclopedias were goods that could identify a citizen interested in education\n","Anyone who would like to see a special model of our planet today has the opportunity to do so in the industrial monument Gasometer Oberhausen in Germany There hangs a monumental sculpture of the Earth with a diameter of 20 meters It is a globe of the digital age that is part of the exhibition The Fragile Paradise which runs until November 26\n","Visitors experience it from

dangerous neighborhoods in the United States Robbery muggings and murder were part of the residents everyday life Youths organized themselves into street gangs taking control of their blocks and fighting each other\n","The Bronx was on fire  literally Firefighters regularly had to put out blazes in tenement blocks as landlords used arson to speculate on insurance premiums\n","The streets were littered with debris and junk the neglected parks attracted drug dealers pimps and prostitutes The entire neighborhood was crumbling with many residential buildings empty and increasingly dilapidated\n","As photojournalist Allan Tannenbaum wrote in an essay describing his personal experience of the area in the early 1970s the Bronx and other parts of New York City such as the Lower East Side BedfordStuyvesant or Harlem looked like European cities after the Second World War\n","There was great poverty with a majority of residents living on welfare Not because they didnt want to work but because there was no employment at all\n","Those who could afford it fled the neighborhood but they also had to find a landlord who would rent them an apartment elsewhere Although racial segregation was officially abolished in the US in the early 1970s many white people did not want to live alongside African Americans and continued to discriminate against them making it difficult for Blacks to change their situation Structural racism also contributed to the fact that it was predominantly African Americans and Latinos who stayed behind in the socially disadvantaged and neglected neighborhoods\n","At the time New York city was almost bankrupt There was really nothing there for kids to do recalls Cindy Campell in a video produced by auction house Christies which is holding a special auction to mark the 50th anniversary of hiphops founding\n","At the time Campbell was in high school and in order to be able to buy clothes for the new school year she decided to throw a party Admittance for boys was 50 cents while girls paid 25 cents according to the flyer for her DJ Kool Herc Party \n","DJ Kool Herc was her 18yearold brother Clive Campbell\n","So on August 11 1973 DJ Kool Herc dragged his sound system consisting of two turntables a mixer an amplifier and a set of speakers into the community room of the tenement building at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx\n","The smell of marijuana was in the air The bass pumped and ripped through the sweating crowd as they danced and partied in the darkened room DJ Hercs buddy Coke La Rock grabbed the microphone greeted the guests and started rapping\n","This later earned him a reputation as the first MC Master of Ceremonies\n","Around 50 people came friends and young people from the neighborhood They experienced the first hiphop party in history  before terms like hiphop or rap had even been coined\n","DJing was nothing special and rapping wasnt new either US comedian Pigmeat Markham had already released a track the single Here Comes the Judge with rhythmic spoken word in 1968\n","What was revolutionary about DJ Kool Hercs technique was that he created new tracks by using the instrumental parts of other songs breaks with drums and bass Since those lyrical breaks are often very short DJ Kool Herc simply used a second copy of the same record on another turntable to lengthen the excerpts by playing them back to back He called this technique the merrygoround and thereby developed a new extremely danceable sound made of breaks\n","Thats also where the term breakdancer comes from  referring to those who dance to the music generated from breaks\n","DJ Kool Herc mixed different styles of music in his performances He wouldnt reveal which records he was using to make sure people would keep coming to his parties to hear his exclusive sound\n","He inherited his passion for music from his father who was an avid record collector and had jazz gospel and country records at home DJ Kool Herc was also interested in soul as well as in modern disco music He was always looking for sounds from which he could create a beat  the basis for a good hiphop track\n","The DJ had set off fireworks on the turntables and word spread quickly around the Bronx Everyone came to Hercs parties recalls rapper Coke La Rock in the Netflix documentary series HipHop Evolution murderers thieves dancers and normal people all came to the events which ultimately moved to the streets and parks when the lounge became too small\n","The block parties were a regular feature in New York City in the 1970s Street lamps were often tapped to supply the music system with electricity\n","In order to stand out as a DJ you had to be loud and DJ Kool Herc had the biggest and loudest speakers in the neighborhood\n","Right from the start hiphop was not just a music genre but an entire culture encompassing DJing rap breakdance graffiti and knowledge It all came together at DJ Kool Hercs parties Just one more reason the legendary party on Sedgwick Avenue is considered the birth of hiphop\n","Anyone who wanted to hear hiphop had to come to the block parties because in the mid1970s hiphop albums werent available for sale nor was the music on the radio\n","It wasnt until 1979 that The Sugarhill Gangs Rappers Delight became the first hiphop song to make the US charts Its a song that is now considered a classic just like The Message by Grandmaster Flash  The Furious Five which came out in 1982 and tells of life in the New York ghetto\n","Hip hop has been the Voice of the Voiceless the story of marginalized communities where people can tell stories about the social inequities that are happening in communities black and brown communities Not just here in America but all around the world said Rocky Bucano director of the Universal HipHop Museum in New York in a promotional video for the museums planned opening in 2024\n","In a video of the web video series Black History in Two Minutes filmmaker Ava DuVernay called hiphop the CNN of the Black community because it poetically reports on everything that Black people experience in everyday life\n","Many US rappers who have made it to the top dont come from the middle class but from the poor backgrounds where hiphop originated\n","Moving from subculture into the mainstream hiphop is now one of the most popular music genres in the world with superstars including Tupac The Notorious BIG LL Cool J Public Enemy the Beastie Boys the WuTang Clan Timbaland JayZ Dr Dre Nas Eminem Nicki Minaj Lil Wayne Drake Missy Elliott Snoop Dogg and Kendrick

speed from 1894 You can see it in our exhibition for the first time In those days there were no street signs or ways of measuring speed But the vehicle drove nearly 30 kilometers per hour so not really fast But the story goes that it drove nearby a restaurant and caused the curtains to flutter indicating that it was going too fast\n","But the exhibitions are not exclusively about Germanys

language\n","SF Latin is a living look into the past and into the functioning of language\n","What is the argument for still learning Latin today\n","Latin teaching imparts metacompetencies that can be applied throughout life to dealing with and learning other foreign languages and in substance do not become obsolete While modern foreign language instruction focuses on communication Latin instruction focuses on language reflection such as how it is different from German how a sentence works how words changed and how certain statements are formulated in certain situations\n","And of course Latin is the common mother of the Romance language family French Italian Spanish Portuguese and Romanian and the origin of numerous English words for instance language computer and artificial intelligence\n","Do students choose Latin instead of for example French or Spanish at the insistence of their parents or because they already have a particular field of study in mind\n","One can only speculate about the students motives Four points are likely to be relevant A general interest in history and mythology and an approach to language more through reflection and analysis than through direct communication In addition a study or career perspective for which Latin seems useful and the teachers who are on average quite young know how critically the public parents and the students view their subject and therefore attach great importance to appealing teaching that has nothing to do with the selective drill from the cliche images\n","For which courses of study and professions in Germany is Latin useful or even a prerequisite\n","What Latin is required for varies It tends to happen less frequently than it used to In any case it is useful for many subjects History philosophy theology Roman studies law Roman law medicine history of medicine terminology pharmacy terminology linguistics all disciplines that deal with the time before about 1750 and the European area History of Music History of Art History of Science Church history local history\n","Latin died out around the 7th or 8th century but when did its significance wane\n","Until the 18th century Latin was the most common language in which newly published books were printed Huge stores of knowledge on all sorts of issues are accessible thanks to my knowledge of Latin since only a tiny part of this neoLatin

energy holding Energeticky Prumyslovy EPH post a record profit of 46 billion 509 billion in 2022 Reports suggest that the Czech billionaire might use those funds to buy the steel unit of Germanys industrial giant ThyssenKrupp\n","That has many not for the first time asking who is Kretinsky anyways\n","On the surface at least the taciturn 48yearold seems a contrast to the older rather gruff and arrogant generation of Czech oligarchs that emerged in the postcommunist years\n","Suave and cosmopolitan on the rare occasions he talks to the media Kretinsky likes to focus on his art collection and do so while sipping green tea\n","Acquisitions across Europe have given him an international profile the likes of which few Central European business magnates have achieved\n","Jerome Lefilliatre a media and business reporter who wrote a biography of Kretinsky in 2019 described him as extremely intelligent very ambitious very determined and very opportunistic  the perfect businessman in an interview for French daily Le Monde in 2020\n","But there is suspicion that Kretinskys remarkable  and largely unexplained  rise to Czechias secondrichest person with a fortune of 94 billion 849 billion in fact relied heavily on the same networks as those earlier unreconstructed tycoons\n","Indeed looking closer the mask can slip with the billionaires words often at odds with his actions\n","To the extent that our results were due to the Russian invasion I do not celebrate them Kretinsky told the Czech edition of Forbes Magazine in April as he discussed EPHs bumper year\n","At its core Kretinskys empire which has an estimated value of over 9 billion is also deeply old fashioned EPH is built on coal and a simple bet against Europes energy transition\n","When Slovak oligarch group JT and PPF  an investment vehicle owned by Czech oligarch Petr Kellner before he died in 2021  founded EPH in 2009 Kretinsky became chairman and a 20 shareholder pitching him into partnership with the top privatization barons of the postcommunist era\n","By 2014 he had full control and was building out EPH using Slovak pipeline operator Eustream  then the main carrier of Russian gas imports to Europe  as a cash cow on which he could leverage debt\n","A feverish acquisition drive followed as cutprice coalbased assets were bought from European energy giants keen to clean up their portfolios\n","A key deal was the 2016 capture by LEAG  a partnership with PPF  of a German lignite mine and power plants from Swedish state giant Vattenfall\n","But the real kicker was Germanys decision to phase out coal from power production by 2038 The government in Berlin has agreed to pay 175 billion to have LEAG shutter four power plants slightly ahead of schedule with further payments for other units to be kept as a backup during the switch to renewable energy\n","Now Germanys secondlargest coal miner EPH has gone on to buy ageing coalbased assets in seven other European countries and controls strategic portions of the national networks of Italy and the UK\n","Most investors need to stress some sort of longterm horizon but Kretinsky ditched that idea says Jan Osicka from Masaryk University in Brno Kretinskys home town With hindsight there was clearly space for someone to make this bet on slower decarbonisation The key for EPH was the scale he told DW\n","However Kretinsky hasnt kept all his eggs in one basket spending recent years shopping enthusiastically in Western Europe\n","Significant stakes have been acquired in supermarket chains in the UK France and Germany On Friday embattled French retail giant Casino said Kretinsky was one of two candidates in the running to buy the debtladen grocery chain Stakes have also been taken in postal services in the UK and Netherlands\n","Having previously joined a trend that sees the Czech media landscape being bought out by oligarchs seeking political clout Kretinsky has sought to replicate the trick in France But journalists at Le Monde blocked his attempt to secure control of Frances newspaper of record proclaiming commitment to an independent press\n","In addition Ukraine labelled German wholesale giant Metro a sponsor of war claiming that key shareholder Kretinsky is closely linked to the oil gas and banking sectors of Russias economy\n","\n","Following these adventures ThyssenKrupp Steel looks like a deal straight out of Kretinskys old playbook\n","An EPH spokesman failed to respond when asked if the billionaire is interested but the carbonheavy industrial giant is unlikely to be expensive ThyssenKrupp has been trying to offload its steel business for some months  and it looks set for a subsidies bonanza\n","Following huge worker protests German Economy Minister Robert Habeck promised in June to do whatever it takes to help decarbonize the steel industry in order to preserve it Berlin has readied 2 billion in support for a planned green steel plant running on hydrogen   \n","In that climate Kretinsky may fancy his chances of securing further support to keep the presses running while EPHs nearby coal assets would likely happily supply energy\n","Kretinskys assumption that governments would have to keep his energy assets afloat turned out correct and you could make similar assumptions regarding ThyssenKrupp said Osicka The German government has made it clear it wont allow these key industries to fall and its guaranteed that huge sums will be pumped into modernization \n","Edited by Uwe Hessler\n","While youre here Every Tuesday DW editors round up what is

The aim was to save and protect foreign culture from destruction during the Russian war The renewed Russian attack on the port city has caused great indignation at UNESCO In an interview with DW Lutz Mller deputy secretary general of the German UNESCO commission stresses that the sites are of universal significance\n","In the buffer zone in the Old Town which is supposed to be protected several museums were attacked and damaged He said that the Archaeological Museum the Maritime Museum and the Literary Museum were especially affected \n","The Archaeological Museum and the Literature Museum are right next to each other while the Maritime Museum is located at the harbor Mller said adding that all three suffered damage Unfortunately we dont yet have comprehensive knowledge of whether the collection they hold are lost forever because the inventory has not yet been completed Mller does not believe that museum employees were injured or killed\n","\n","Other cultural sites on the outskirts of the Old City such as the Transfiguration Cathedral founded in 1794 are also said to have been damaged Images of collapsed domes and roofs as well as a destroyed altar and icons inside have been circulating online\n","You dont have to be an expert to see that the structural integrity of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is severely compromised Mller said The Transfiguration Cathedral had already been destroyed in 1936 on Joseph Stalins orders and rebuilt in 1999 as close to the original as possible Catherine the Great founder of Odesa once ordered the church to be built and dedicated it to the Transfiguration of Christ The church was visited by the Russian Patriarch Kirill as recently as 2010\n","The attack on Odesa is the second time that a world heritage city has been shelled during Russias war on Ukraine Just two weeks ago Lviv was hit by missiles\n","It is an obligation not only for Ukraine to preserve these sites but for the whole world Mller emphasized UNESCO protects them not only because of the importance for the national identity of Ukraine Indeed the sites exceed the significance of a single state\n","\n","Several thousand monuments considered significant from UNESCOs and Ukraines point of view have been marked with a white and blue shield for the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts We would like to secure these sites with the white and blue shield so that they are not shelled Mller said\n","Since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 2022 270 incidents causing damage to Ukrainian cultural sites have been recorded as well as to 3500 educational institutions such as schools or libraries\n","UNESCO has pledged support either in the form of personnel or financial assistance for reconstruction the UN cultural body says\n","One possibility is that reconstruction is done under the coordination of UNESCO depending on the degree of damage It may also be enough to raise money to help Ukraine rebuild Mller said\n","The latest attack on culture in Odesa coincides with the destruction of the Cultural Center for Folk Art and Art Education in the city of Mykolaiv just over 100 kilometers 62 miles away\n","\n","German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said that Russias targeted attacks on the museums in Odesa show once again this war is an attack on all areas of Ukrainian society and democracy with a particular focus on their independent culture\n","In addition by bombing the World Heritage Old Town of Odesa Russia is directly attacking a significant part of the cultural heritage of humanity Roth continued This criminal violence against the people of Ukraine as well as their cultural assets must end and be stopped immediately by Russia\n","She added that the German government continues to

accomplices: Wagner, Speer and Bechstein 22.07.2023 ****\"\n","German publisher Hugo Bruckmann and his wife Elsa were among the early and highly influential promoters of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler They first officially invited him to their estate in 1924 Their literary salon where intellectuals of various religions and opinions had met for intellectual exchange before World War I was frequented in the 1920s primarily by German nationalists who railed against democracy and the Weimar Republic\n","Among them was Hitlers later star architect Albert Speer but also the married couple Winifred and Siegfried Wagner who organized the famous Bayreuth Festival in celebration of German composer Richard Wagner Elsa Bruckmann provided a forum for all those who mourned Germanys imperial era and suffered from the economic crisis or the ignominy of the lost First World War\n","The longing for a messiah was great and the hopes of the upper middle classes were pinned on Hitler explains Sven Friedrich director of the Richard Wagner Museum in Bayreuth Hitler had inspired Elsa Bruckmann and many others with his indoctrinating speeches and his visions of a new great Germany The couple provided financial support to the leader of the National Socialist Party NSDAP and Elsa Bruckmann took pleasure in dressing him appropriately Through her Hitler also established crucial connections with prominent industrialists\n","Adolf Hitler felt comfortable in these circles After all he had not received any significant education and had barely managed to make a living as an art and postcard painter in Vienna He lacked a proper upbringing and background he had to acquire everything on his own Sven Friedrich elaborates\n","Winifred Wagner the daughterinlaw of composer Richard Wagner was also one of Hitlers supporters Winifred was enthralled by Hitler due to his sense of mission and his profound admiration for Wagners music says Friedrich From the very beginning he had promised her that he would take care of the Bayreuth Festival once he had power in Germany\n","A friendship quickly developed between the two At times Adolf Hitler lived with the Wagners at their estate A prominent member of the family was also Houston Stewart Chamberlain an influential BritishGerman race theorist antisemite and a mastermind of the National Socialist movement He was married to Richard Wagners daughter Eva For Hitler Chamberlain was an idol says Friedrich\n","In 1923 the National Socialists led by Adolf Hitler made an unsuccessful attempt to violently overthrow the government of the Weimar Republic in Munich As a consequence of this failed coup Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison He began serving his sentence in the spring of 1924 at Landsberg Fortress and was granted early release later the same year\n","This imprisonment at Landsberg Fortress was more of a house arrest where one lived comfortably with likeminded comrades Friedrich points out The Wagners are not to be found on the visitors list but they kept up a lively correspondence with Hitler Winifred Wagner sent him sweets and writing paper It was on this paper that Hitler wrote his book Mein Kampf Elsa Bruckmann later offered to be the editor for the second edition\n","Alongside Elsa Bruckmann the names of Helene and Edwin Bechstein are also on the list of Hitlers visitors in prison The Bechstein piano company founded in 1853 by Carl Bechstein was a wellestablished German business at the time and is still one of the biggest piano manufacturers today Until the war most prominent pianists played on a Bechstein piano or grand piano says Gregor Willmes a musicologist and cultural manager at the Bechstein company Inflation in the 1920s hit the company hard\n","Edwin one of Carls sons had cashed out early on and had some wealth He and his wife supported Hitlers plans and like the Wagners they also hosted Hitler in their villa\n","Once Adolf Hitler gained power the Bayreuth Festival was under his personal protection because the Wagners had always supported him He reciprocated by granting Bayreuth substantial financial subsidies says museum director Sven Friedrich The National Socialists ensured that the performances known as the War Festival Performances continued until 1944\n","With the start of World War II Hitlers visits to the upperclass ladies became less frequent Elsa Bruckmann distanced herself from Hitler because of the atrocities committed on his orders in the persecution of the Jews and in the war However she is said to have retained her nationalist sentiments until her death in 1951\n","Winifred Wagner remained an ardent supporter of Hitler and National Socialism after the war She  like her son Wieland who had stood closely by Hitlers side  had to go through a socalled denazification procedure She was not allowed to continue in her position as festival director in Bayreuth She continued to meet with acquaintances from the Nazi era\n","Hitlers architect Albert Speer was sentenced to 20 years in prison Other cultural figures like sculptor Arno Breker or conductors Wilhelm Furtwngler and Herbert von Karajan had cooperated with Hitler but the Allies eventually classified them as fellow travelers Mitlufer and they were able to resume their activities successfully after a time Breker even created works commissioned by the German government after the war And conductor Friedrich Furtwngler was celebrated during his tours with the Berlin Philharmonic in Europe Wieland Wagner on the other hand took over management of the Bayreuth Festival together with his brother Wolfgang They introduced a new aesthetic with lighting effects and sparse stage designs and Wieland was hailed as a great innovator in stage direction\n","Helene and Edwin Bechsteins closeness with Hitler had also damaged the reputation of the piano making company after the war Nevertheless they kept the name We carry the name of course because of Carl Bechstein who was an important personality and promoted art and culture but we are aware of this inglorious history surrounding Helene and Edwin says cultural manager Gregor Willmes Today the company works with many Jewish and Palestinian pianists from Israel and supports musical projects that deal with National Socialism No one from the Bechstein family itself is still with the company \n","The Bayreuth Festival Hall is no longer owned by the Wagner family but is maintained by the public Richard Wagner Foundation Today artistic director Katharina Wagner granddaughter of Winifred Wagner has confronted her familys National Socialist past Her goal from the beginning has been to lead the Festival into a modern age\n","This article has been translated from German\n"," \n","\n","\n","'*** Germany: Court

Karlsruhebased court ruled Friday However presiding Judge Bettina Brckner acknowledged that the collector was in a predicament as the painting would likely be difficult to sell According to the ruling the interests of former owners or their legal successors and the general publics interest outweighed the current owners interest when it comes to cultural property possibly confiscated by the Nazis\n","The plaintiff could choose to attempt legal action in an administrative court against the operator of the Lost Art Database the German Center for Lost Cultural Property the presiding judge in Karlsruhe said The court did not publish the plaintiffs name\n","Previously the man had sued the trustees of a Canadian foundation that had commissioned the search for his artwork Calabrian Coast

individual from Essen In September 1937 he was forced to give up his gallery and he emigrated two months later via England to Canada where he died in 1987 A Canadian trust currently administers his estate \n","\n","The plaintiff had bought the painting at auction in London in 1999 which meant there was no doubt about his rightful ownership While the work was on exhibition in BadenBaden in 2016 he learned that it was listed in the Lost Art Database and was being sought by Interpol \n","A settlement between the current owner and the Canadian trust that administered Max Sterns estate fell through In court the collector wanted the trustees to stop claiming ownership of the painting He also wanted the search notice removed The man indicated he did not want any further criticism of his property He had previously also failed to have the entry deleted in lower courts\n","The Lost Art Database is a publiclyaccessible database set up by the German Lost Art Foundation to keep track of artworks looted or expropriated by the Nazis\n","The German Center for Lost Cultural Property said it would await the detailed written justification for the ruling before considering any need for action But it welcomed the ruling itself and said that by operating the database the Center was contributing to Germanys obligation to come to terms with Nazi injustice \n","lossms dpa AFP

imposes ban on Russian-language culture 20.07.2023 ****'\n","Street musicians singing Russian songs in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv could soon face problems Likewise bars and restaurants playing Russian background music may end up getting in trouble\n","The reason is that Kyiv city council has issued a temporary ban on performing or showcasing Russianlanguage art and culture  such as books music plays and concerts  in public This ban also encompasses cultural and educational programs The restriction not only applies to works by Russian authors and creators but to all cultural products publicly presented in or translated into Russian\n","Ukrainian MPs said the move was designed to protect Ukraine from Russian influence Russia is the language of the aggressor and it has no place in the heart of our capital said Vadym Vasylchuk the deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Education and Science Youth and Sports\n","The move is backed by Ukraines Vidsich Defense movement which began calling for a ban on the Russian language and Russian goods films and music in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea A ban on Russianlanguage cultural products is necessary Vidsich activist Kateryna Chepura told DW This is an additional lever for activists working to boycott everything Russian so we can say shut it down remove Russian from public life\n","The Kyiv city council ban however is temporary lending it a symbolic quality only A permanent legally binding ban would require support from Ukrainian parliament the Verkhovna Rada\n","As a result Chepura calls Kyivs temporary ban an ineffective instrument because you cannot be held accountable for disregarding it She regards it as a moral factor encouraging people who do not want to continue tolerating Russian music on the streets or in theater\n","In fact certain Russianlanguage cultural products are already prohibited in Ukraine The bans date back to September 2019 when the first restrictions were imposed in the region of Lviv Subsequently other cities like Ternopil and Zhytomyr in the Volhynia region followed suit\n","Human rights activist Volodymyr Yavorskyy of the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties however said such bans are discriminatory and unconstitutional These are illegal decisions because local authorities have no right to regulate such issues and impose such bans Yavorskyy told DW That is why they have no legal consequences The judiciary he added had already deemed such local bans illegal\n","A person violating the Kyiv city council moratorium on Russian cultural products cannot be held accountable Yaworskyy said These bans issued by local authorities are nothing but political gestures  only the Ukrainian parliament can turn such bans into law Only then he said would they become legally binding and enforceable\n","In June 2022 the Ukrainian parliament already banned publicly playing songs by Russian artists The restriction does not however apply to Russian singers who condemn Russias war against Ukraine Recently Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed a law banning the import and distribution of Russian books It was passed by parliament last year\n","Regardless of whether or not local bans are in place playing Russian music in public is bound to cause controversy Take for instance a recent disagreement between a 17yearold busker and Ukrainian MP Natalya Pipa She complained when the teenager performed songs by Russian rock legend Viktor Tsoi on the street in Lviv who in return insulted the woman saying he was allowed to play whatever music he liked Later however the busker published a video in which he apologized to the lawmaker\n","Another altercation occurred in the village of Pohreby in the Kyiv region There a young woman was thrown out of a cafe for complaining that the establishment was playing a song by Russian pop singer Grigory Leps supporting Russias war against Ukraine\n","Yevgenia Belorusets a Ukrainian artist translator and author who works in Ukrainian Russian and German says the Russianlanguage ban is discriminatory These bans perpetuate the myth that Ukrainian culture is always being discriminated against she told DW This then supposedly gives it the right to discriminate against other forms of cultural expression\n","Ukrainianlanguage culture knows too well how discrimination feels she added It should not try to overcome this trauma by inflicting similar pain on others The creator said Ukraine should not mirror Russian aggressors and refrain from projecting Russias aggressive intentions onto Ukraines complex cultural situation\n","Belorusets said language bans could divide Ukrainian society warning that its getting harder and harder to talk about this in Ukraine because doing so is immediately labeled as a hostile act Ukraines future as a democratic state she said depends on granting everyone their rights and accepting their own complicated past The challenge consists in accepting competing views within society\n","This article was translated from German\n"," \n","\n","\n","\"*** Myanmar's artists and the forgotten civil war 20.07.2023 ****\"\n","The oil painting that opens the exhibition has a spectacular journey behind it rolled up and disguised as hand luggage it was recently smuggled out of Myanmar Titled Bitch better have my democracy its a striking and colorful work by artist Richie Htet who painted it soon after Myanmars military coup in February 2021 I wanted to encourage us at that time There were a lot of images of the atrocities circulating on the Internet I wanted to create something triumphant Htet tells DW When he posted it on social media the image immediately went viral\n","Today the painting is considered an icon of courageous protests against the military dictatorship that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of people and forced some 15 million to flee the country Htets painting shows the darkhaired beauty Mie Bamar Pyi a personification of Myanmar bearing a shield in one hand and a spear in the other She attacks an Ogre a demon from Buddhist mythology who is dressed as a general from Myanmars military junta The motif references both Asian and Western icons it quotes the battle of the Hindu goddess Durga against a demon while also calling to mind Christian depictions of the Archangel Michael defeating Satan\n","For painter Richie Htet the work represents the collective effort of Myanmars people to fight the military junta So for Li Li coorganizer of the exhibition We Are the Seeds The Art of Myanmars Spring Revolution its a small miracle that this painting can be seen until July 21 at the Open Society Foundation in Berlin If the painting had to be rolled out at airport security when it left the country our contact probably would have ended up in jail Li Li tells DW\n","The exhibition includes works by 18 Myanmar artists most of whom live in exile in Paris like coorganizer Li Li and Richie Htet With the wideranging show featuring paintings installations sound and video Li Li wants to draw attention to the civil war that has largely been forgotten in Europe The military already had experience this is now the third coup From the past they knew about the power that can come from artists during protests Thats why they were and are particularly vulnerable\n","The 29yearold Htet is considered a promising painter in Myanmars contemporary art scene which gained international attention following the democratization of the country in 2011 He grew up under the military dictatorship and outed himself as gay at just 14 years old  an act of bravery since homosexuality while not illegal in Myanmar is considered unnatural in the country After studying in London Htet returned to Yangon where he became the art director of a fashion magazine\n","It was a time of awakening and sheer unbridled creativity Htet began to paint homoerotic images that played with Indian and South Asian mythologies which from his point of view are rich in queer characters In his first solo exhibition A Chauk a Burmese epithet for homosexual men he showed women in positions of power and naked men as objects of desire at the gallery Myanmart in 2020\n","The first queer exhibition in Myanmar became a success all of Htets paintings sold and he decided to live exclusively from his art Then in February 2021 the violent military coup detat ended not only his dreams but also Yangons diverse cultural life I was quite devastated I felt like the future was sort of ripped away from me because I was planning on living and working in Yangon I was planning on making it my home\n","After some of Htets family members were imprisoned he saw only one way out escaping to France with the help of an artist scholarship When I left my father was super sick at that point so I knew that when I said goodbye to my father it was the last time I would see him His father died the next year\n","The artist and musician Pinky also decided to leave Myanmar in spring 2021 Her bandmate was arrested and his laptop on which joint protest actions were stored was confiscated Pinky Htut Aung waited in Bangkok for several months until she too was able to take up a scholarship in Paris Now like Richie Htet and Li Li she can stay permanently as a political refugee\n","Pinky is a multifaceted artist The 31yearold composes music paints and works with sound collages For the Berlin exhibition she devoted her attention to clouds Ive been obsessed with clouds since I was a child Theyre very spiritual for me They never die and they transform just like our spirit\n","Her milky translucent work hangs freely from the ceiling accompanied by celestial sounds The clouds are not painted but instead burned into thick translucent paper with the help of a candle I was afraid I would set my small apartment on fire in the process she says Pinky says she made a conscious decision to experiment with fire for the piece In Paris of course I follow the events in Myanmar On my smartphone I see something on fire all the time \n"," \n"," \n","People across the board in Myanmar are afraid says Franz Xaver Augustin who was able to reopen the GoetheInstitut in Yangon in 2014 after several years of preparation and served as its director until 2019 I experienced Myanmar before it opened in 2011 It was terrible an atmosphere of fear During the period of democratization the Institute was an important resource for artists and it remains a refuge for them these days Augustin has accompanied some of the artists now exhibiting in Berlin from the beginning At the time he would not have thought it possible that they would soon have to flee their country\n","Richie Htet has been politicized by the military coup In addition to homoerotic images his work now deals with the civil war in his country\n","The militarys tactics have become more brutal during the course of the war  using sexual violence and wiping out entire villages In addition decapitated and dismembered bodies have been found some of which had been disemboweled\n","The Berlin exhibition features a disturbing painting by Htet Autopsy of the Irrawaddy depicting a sewnup corpse I want to show the atrocities the army is committing against the population he says\n","Artists like Richie Htet and Pinky initially stood stunned and speechless before these atrocities They belong to the generation that blossomed with the opening of their country  and whose trust was shaken to the core after another military coup With their paintings and installations they have found their voices again And they will not stop using them to speak out about the civil war on their own terms\n","Edited by Jon Shelton\n"," \n","\n","\n","\"*** Bruce Lee:

real combat as well as challenging life situations Jeet Kune Do consists of physical techniques and applied philosophies and requires the individual to train him or herself to their most cultivated state of beingness according to the Bruce Lee Foundations website Perfect awareness of ones own body and peace with ones own place in the world is vital to Lees life work\n","His advice to be water my friend has also been muchquoted down the years and is linked to this philosophy of malleability and complete awareness of ones own physical and spiritual self Like water pouring into a cup and

bankable AsianAmerican Hollywood star and despite his untimely death he managed to pave the way for future generations He was one of the first AsianAmerican stars to have a starring role in a major international movie\n","But his role as a wellread philosopher and thinker also deserves more attention from history The book Artist of Life takes excerpts from his own private diaries Meanwhile his

fans\n","With six goals in five games Popps blistering form led Germany to another big showdown after a few years in international wilderness\n","But after tweaking a muscle during extra shooting practice in her final training session Popps dream of glory slipped away once again\n","It was extremely hard to grasp that I probably couldnt play a European Championship final she told DW It took me a really long time to process it There were a lot of questions  should I have trained at all should I have taken that one more shot\n","Popp pulled herself out of the starting lineup shortly before kickoff Even though her aerial prowess would have still caused chaos for England she sacrificed her dream for the team\n","Its one reason why she is so loved among fans and why she commands respect from teammates who describe her as an icon\n","This journey toward inspirational leader started at a very young age in Germanys Ruhrgebiet where a footballmad region forged a footballobsessed future Germany captain\n","I felt like I never had any other choice but to play football said Popp I started extremely early when I was 4 Right from birth I felt like I was always on a football pitch or in a gym\n","Such is life for many in a region where Germanys fiercest derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke captivates national and international audiences\n","Popps hero growing up in the small town of Gevelsberg was Andreas Mller whom she admired from the Westfalenstadion stands with her mother and brother in Dortmund colors\n","My father no chance hes a Schalke fan said Popp laughing I was so proud the first time I stood in the stadium and saw the Yellow Wall felt the atmosphere That was an incredible experience\n","Football was automatically entrenched in her soul and soon seeped into her legs as she realized she was pretty good at the game\n","At 16 Popp made two big moves that would shape her professional career  the first was enrolling in school at the Gesamtschule Berger Feld run by none other than Schalke\n","Here alongside her studies Popp trained as the only girl with talented Schalke youths like Joel Matip Ralf Fhrmann and Max Meyer which she said was essential to her development\n","I have to say it wasnt easy to make it work she said At first the boys were very skeptical and didnt really know how to deal with me But fairly early on we played five versus two and they saw OK shes got something It calmed down quickly after that\n","Just as crucially Popp earned a contract with FCR Duisburg a German powerhouse at the time She was now training with World Cup winners such as Inka Grings Simone Laudehr and Annike Krahn and arrived with the typical swagger and arrogance of a teenager\n","I was very cheeky when I was younger said Popp with a smile I moved to Duisburg and actually thought Hey Im here now and Im more or less better than you But I was soon shown very quickly that I wasnt\n","She was quite young in her character too recalled exDuisburg teammate Krahn But you could see that she had a certain talent you saw that quickly on the pitch And you could tell that she would progress in the years to come\n","Popp won the UEFA Cup now Champions League and the German Cup in her first season at Duisburg And in 2010 she made her name on the international stage winning the U20 World Cup with Germany after scoring an incredible 10 goals in six games\n","She was already somewhat of a leader at that time I wouldnt say she was a naturalborn leader but it was beginning to emerge And she also developed in that direction quickly said Krahn\n","Under the tutelage of Grings Popp started to master the art of goal scoring and would soon cement her place as Germanys goto striker\n","It was in Wolfsburg however that Popp truly grew into the dominant striker and leader she is today In 11 years shes scored 152 goals and won seven Bundesliga titles nine German Cups and two Champions League trophies\n","In her first season in 201213 Wolfsburg won the treble after defeating heavy favorites Lyon in the Champions League final\n","\n","Personally I thought Lyon played with a certain arrogance which just motivated us even more said Popp And we did it in the end None of us could believe it And we couldnt believe wed also won the treble That was a feeling that cant be described\n","At the age of 22 Popp had won it all in club football But then began a rough run of injuries An injury aggravated in the Champions League final meant she missed Euro 2013 which Germany won And she sat out Euro 2017 as well after injuring herself during pretournament preparations\n","And although she did win Gold at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics with Germany injuries were threatening to curtail her international career so much so that at times she contemplated retirement\n","I think you learn something new with every injury said Krahn You get to know your body better you develop your personality differently and value your time on the pitch differently\n","So when Popp finally got to play in that European Championship in 2022 there was a feeling of redemption in the air\n","That fateful injury sustained in shooting practice however robbed her of her big moment Germany lost 21 in extra time without their inspirational captain even though she was their biggest fan on the side of the pitch\n","I think with a bit of reflection she can be very proud of what she achieved And also proud of how she dealt with it said Krahn\n","Now its time to go again And there is fire in Popps belly as she looks to lead Germany back to the top of international football at the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand\n","She shows that you should just keep at it stay on your path and not let anything get you down Shes definitely inspired me a lot said Kathrin Hendrich Poppi is an icon If you ask anyone in Germany which footballer comes to mind first then she would be top of the list\n","That adulation makes Popp the star attraction whenever Germany trains or plays but shes purely focused on leading her team back to the top of international football Shes said multiple times in the past weeks that Germany believe they can go all the way\n","Im really looking forward to the World Cup And I think we can play a big role in the title race she said\n","Germany face Morocco Colombia and South Korea in Group H Topping the group and navigating the round of 16 could line up a potential rematch against England in the quarterfinals\n","Theres little doubt Popp will have extra motivation to play in that showdown It will be another chance to make up for lost time and find redemption\n","The 34yearold is one of the biggest stars of womens football The forward has won two FIFA Womens World Cup titles and an Olympic gold Her daughter Elena arrived in 2020 As much as I love playing soccer and doing that every single day I now play for more than myself I dont know if I would say Im a different player I just think that Im

was serving a fiveyear sentence in prison No 1 in the small city of Grodno in western Belarus\n","Pushkin had an ulcer and did not receive timely medical treatment independent Belarusian media reported citing unnamed sources informed on the matter He was arrested in March 2021 and a year later sentenced for desecrating state symbols and inciting hatred\n","The reason Pushkin had painted a portrait of Yevgeny Shikhar the leader of the Belarusian antiSoviet underground after World War II and shown it at an exhibition\n","Belarusian investigators considered this to be rehabilitation of Nazism even though he created the painting back in 2014 and it had previously been displayed in Belarus and Russia\n","The terms of Pushkins incarceration were tightened in November 2022 Not long after he was transferred from prison No 22 in   Ivatsevichy in the Brest region to Grodno Pushkin had a hard time from the beginning said Aliaksandr Ivulin a journalist and former political prisoner who was in the same jail as Pushkin\n","He was too friendly Ivulin said even to the prison guards who took away his notes and drawings without giving him a reason\n","Once moved to prison No 1 his exchange of letters with the Belarusian artist Lera Lasuk ended DW has learned After that Pushkin was only allowed to write to his family From the new prison he sent drawings and described his daily life and his cellmates He made sketches of larger works that he wanted to complete once he was released\n","We had some disagreements but we were joined by our love of art and of Belarus I value him for his bright iconic pieces for his courage and for standing up for his principles said Lasuk\n","Pushkin was a nonconformist painter theatermaker performer and curator He staged one of his first performance pieces during Soviet rule in Belarus in 1989 And not on any day He chose the 71st anniversary of the Belarusian Peoples Republic The states existence was proclaimed on March 25 1918 under German protectorate but ceased to exist shortly after when part of its territory was won by the Polish armed forces and the other part by the Soviet Red Army in the PolishSoviet War of 1919 to 1921\n","Pushkin began the anniversary with a march through Independence Avenue in Minsk followed by about a hundred supporters carrying a paper stork and 71 white balloons Pushkin and 35 other people were arrested and the artist received a twoyear suspended sentence\n","Pushkins most famous performance was Dung for the President in July 1999 On the fifth anniversary of Alexander Lukashenkos ascent to power the artist transported a pile of manure to the presidential administration in Minsk threw worthless ruble notes on top and added the countrys constitution plus a portrait of the ruler for good measure Then he stabbed everything with a pitchfork\n","For this stunt the artist was also given a twoyear suspended sentence Pushkin reenacted the performance at an exhibition in Kyiv on March 25 2021 This appears to have prompted Belarusian authorities to charge him with desecration of state symbols\n","Pushkin also worked on the restoration of historical buildings and on church frescoes His most important work in his view was the decoration of the new church of his home village Bobr near Minsk\n","In one of the frescoes Pushkin depicted Lukashenko and the thenmetropolitan a leadership position in some Orthodox churches of the unrecognized Ukrainian Orthodox Church Filaret among sinners surrounded by forces of the Belarusian special police unit OMON The fresco was later painted over\n","Rights organizations in Belarus like Viasna the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and Legal Initiative considered Pushkin a political prisoner The leader of the Belarusian democratic opposition movement Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya who lives in exile in Lithuania has blamed the artists death on Lukashenko\n","Ales Pushkin was the embodiment of the indomitable spirit of the

to do to make a great work of art Instead it revealed itself to be a book on how to be writes Rick Rubin about his approach to The Creative Act A Way of Being\n","You can pretty much find a bestselling selfhelp book about anything these days from decluttering your mind to your wardrobe Sometimes selfimprovement book themes seem so trite it leaves you thinking  is this really whats going to make you transform your life\n","But since the prolific US music producer is already seen by many in the industry as a guru it only makes sense to have him share his wisdom with the masses The Creative Act A Way of Being brings creativity into a new realm of selfdiscovery \n","Rubin started his career in the 1980s as a 20yearold university student when he founded his record label Def Jam in his dorm room in New York\n","After Russell Simmons joined the company things took off Rubin discovered the Beastie Boys and convinced them to abandon punk and turn to rap\n","Def Jam played a pivotal role in popularizing hip hop by signing acts including LL Cool J RunDMC and Public Enemy and later JayZ and Foxy Brown\n","Rubin helped Aerosmith make a comeback in 1986 recording a remake of their 1975 song Walk This Way with the rap trio RunDMC \n","Later Rubin sold his shares in Def Jam for a threedigit million sum moved to Los Angeles started a new label and also worked as a producer for artists signed to other record labels\n","In the 1990s the songdoctor with the long untamed beard produced the Red Hot Chili Peppers album Blood Sugar Sex Magik that shot the band into international popularity Rubins touch also allowed country music icon Johnny Cash to make a major comeback with his awardwinning American Recordings album series \n","He helped the heavy metal band Metallica out of a musical crisis with the 2008 album Death Magnetic and produced works with many more of the worlds top stars His CV also includes collaborations with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers Mick Jagger Eminem Rage Against the Machine U2 Ed Sheeran Lady Gaga Adele and many more\n","Rubin has said in interviews that he doesnt even know how to play an instrument nor does he have much of an idea about studio technology To produce an album he places importance on how he feels\n","In his book he puts it this way When the work has five mistakes its not finished But when a work has eight mistakes it might be Sometimes deciding a work is finished is more about surrender than victory\n","Rick Rubin is a spiritual man drawing inspiration from Eastern philosophy and cosmic influences The studio on his ranch in the hills of Malibu is called ShangriLa named after the fictional paradise in the high Tibetan mountains in James Hiltons novel Lost Horizon\n","Rubin has enough knowledge and experience to write 10 books It is said that some publishers hoped hed spice up his book with anecdotes of big names hes worked with to make it more commercial\n","But Rubin avoids namedropping and he also doesnt think he has all the answers In the preface he advises readers to take on what helps them and leave the rest  \n","Various obstacles including selfdoubt and everyday distractions get in the way of living out our best creative selves according to Rubin He has developed his own strategies to deal with creative blocks and the pressure to exceed or at least match the success of the last album\n","Despite all the hits Rubins portfolio is by no means limited to successful records For him as he states in his book  success is measured neither by popularity nor by money but internally\n","In the case of a creative block Rubin recommends visualizing a completely different audience for a song thats being worked on or simply writing fewer lyrics because sometimes letting go is the best way to stick to a project Sometimes he simply turns off the lights in the studio to change the atmosphere\n","Nevertheless creativity also requires a certain level of discipline for which Rubin lays down some ground rules even though he later in the book contradicts himself by writing that artistic creation is based on disregarding rules letting them go and subverting them\n","Some of the wisdom he shares in The Creative Act might appear too simplistic including truisms such as The better you feel the better things go\n","Other parts of the book give more substantial advice though they often echo words of wisdom already heard elsewhere Creativity can just be a relationship with yourself No one else needs to be in the equation he writes Sometimes the therapeutic value of making the work is the outcome And thats enough\n","The producer whose net worth is estimated at  300 million often emphasizes in the book that creativity shouldnt be about sales Putting commercial concerns before personal taste is a losing battle\n","Anything can be a source of inspiration he says especially nature Rubin recommends always walking through life attentively and trying things out without worrying about the meaning or a measurable result It stands in contrast to societys capitalistic values\n","Obviously not every creative undertaking requires a fat bank account Nevertheless the challenge for ordinary people in implementing Rubins lessons is likely to be the daily grind which is not exactly known as a driving force for creativity Creative contemplation is a luxury that wont pay the bills\n","In one of last years episodes of Rubins podcast Broken Record he talked with the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers Anthony Kiedis They discussed the bands two latest albums Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen which were produced by Rubin Released within a few months in 2022 they received generally positive reviews\n","Both producer and singer seemed very pleased with the results They talked about recording in Hawaii where they were able to work undisturbed for months during the pandemic lockdown Every day Kiedis rode his bike through heavenly landscapes to work with Rubin\n","Kiedis shared that he would not have been able to do it without escaping the daily grind bigcity traffic and other distractions\n","Perhaps palm trees are not a prerequisite for creativity But they dont hurt either\n","This article was originally written in German\n","The most recent biopic released June 23 is about the life of Elvis Presley played by Austin

fighting against a computer program that has gotten out of control and is threatening to wipe out humanity\n","The Mission Impossible franchise is a recipe for success for Hollywood One of the aspects that makes the series so popular is that Tom Cruise performs many of the film stunts himself without the aid of CGI or stunt doubles That approach has turned him into an action megastar\n","Unforgettable scenes in the previous movies include Tom Cruise climbing up the worlds tallest building the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai or hanging from a plane as it takes off\n","A highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump\n","Like the John Wick films with Keanu Reeves the Mission Impossible franchise counters the trend of having blockbuster

Wick 3 Reeves confirmed in an interview that he did almost all of the stunt work himself I do all of the action Im 90 percent of whats happening there Im maintaining the connection to the audience and with the story\n","Indiana Jones star Harrison Ford cant be left out of any list of actors performing their own stunts\n","The 80yearold actor has had an impressive film career spanning six decades His most successful films include the Star Wars saga and the Indiana Jones series\n","The opening scene of the first Indiana Jones movieRaiders of the Lost Ark is particularly iconic with Harrison Ford running away from a giant boulder that is chasing him Even though the rock was a prop it was still heavy enough to seriously injure the actor who was not doubled in the scene\n","Ford completely immersed himself in the role of daredevil archeologist Indiana Jones\n","In the recently released Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny he still took over many stunts himself dislocating his shoulder

brought together a group of artists in exile\n","But in 2021 a cloud descended on the famous theater when some of those in power and executive director Shermin Langhoff faced allegations of bullying and misuse of power  of creating what German magazine Der Spiegel called a climate of fear\n","The theater along with other German publicly funded stages promised to take the allegations seriously and put change into effect if necessary\n","But recent research by German public broadcaster ARD shows that 90 of those who responded to an anonymous survey  apparently including former and current employees of Maxim Gorki Theater  claimed to have experienced abuse In most cases the allegations were of verbal abuse but several cases of alleged physical and sexual abuses were also reported\n","Theater bosses have questioned the representative nature of the survey given that it was conducted anonymously and without independent fact checking But according to the biggest union of German theater workers the GDBA Guild of the German Stage the problems the survey highlights are very real\n","We take the survey very seriously To be clear It is not a scientific study The survey itself also explicitly presents its results as nonrepresentative But that does not make it any less meaningful trade union general secretary Lauren Schubbe told DW\n","The ARD subsidiary RBB teams research shows that hundreds of theater professionals are willing to take the time and feel the need to share their experiences of abuse of power in theaters It has produced 400 detailed accounts of specific cases each one of which is one too many\n","He mentioned the MeToo movement and the conditions that emerged through the COVID pandemic as reasons why people may now be more willing to speak out\n","However we do not conclude from this that there was less abuse of power in theaters in the past he added On the contrary there have already been the first tentative successes and measures to curb it\n","In reaction to the MeToo wave of scandals several theaters have introduced codes of conduct over the course of the past few years But measuring how effective these codes of conduct are is not an exact science\n","This is a situation that cannot be tolerated Claudia Schmitz the director of the Deutscher Bhnenverein an organization that represents 430 German theaters said in a statement The question is how to proceed and my answer is that the path that the stages have been taking since 2018 must be consistently continued\n","Her solution referred to the valuesbased code of conduct which many German theaters agreed to in 2018 and again in 2021\n","Volksbhne for example one of Berlins other major publiclyfunded theaters told DW that the staff council and the womens representative of the Volksbhne regularly invite employees to a meeting of the Code of Conduct working group This is an open committee of Volksbhne employees that has set itself the task of promoting a harassmentfree working environment\n","Claudia Schmitz from the Deutscher Bhnenverein is clear that such programs can work It is not just a piece of paper from the association but an expression of opinion from all members including the theater directors and artistic directors who say that we have a responsibility to ensure that the theater is a space free of fear and that we deal with power in a way that does not lead to discrimination or injury Schmitz said She also indicated that a fresh generation at the helm of certain theaters may help implement these codes of conduct\n","Codes of conduct have also been brought in by organizations connected with German stars who have recently been embroiled in allegations of misconduct in other industries including Till Lindemann of band Rammstein and actor producer and director Till Schweiger\n","But union representative Schubbe said that such codes of conduct are toothless unless they are backed up by concrete and binding measures such as counseling services complaints procedures and sanction options\n","In order to achieve fundamental improvements we must also question what makes abuse of power in theaters structurally favorable and then also change these structures he added\n","One of the problems raised by respondents to the survey is related to the length of contracts Contracts are regularly only renewed every few theater seasons meaning that those whose visas and residency rights are linked to their jobs may be more vulnerable to abuse and less likely to speak out\n","An ongoing dispute between the Bhnenverein representing the employers and the trade union representing the employees once again failed to reach any conclusions on the topic in June\n","Like all performing arts industries German theaters have struggled to bounce back since the pandemic and the ongoing cost of living crisis\n","DW has been in contact with Maxim Gorki Theater about this report who were unable to provide a

tattoo when she was 20 It was at the hands of her husband \n","Tattoos are misunderstood in Japan she tells DW surrounded by stencils of intricate tattoo designs and pictures of his satisfied clients\n","Tattoos have always been associated with the underworld gangs but I had hoped that would change over time Even though there is no stigma attached to tattoos in other countries Japanese society is not ready to change says Nakano\n","Now 77 Horiyoshi has said in interviews that he first became mesmerized by tattoos at the age of 11 or 12 after he saw a yakuza member with a traditional full body tattoo at his local public bathhouse He earned the title Horiyoshi III after working as an apprentice for the legendary tattoo master Shodai Horiyoshi of Yokohama\n","The winner of countless awards for his work Horiyoshi used to do the outlines of his designs by hand until the 1990s when he started using electric machines Colors and shading are still added with the traditional tebori technique which uses a slender bamboo or metal rod with needles attached to the tip\n","As with most Japanese tattoo artists Horiyoshis designs are variations of iridescent koi carp dragons tigers snakes peony flowers and maple leaves Others are inspired by Buddhist deities or creatures from mythology Bright pink cherry blossoms are also popular designs\n","In an interview with The Japan Times newspaper Horiyoshi once said The creatures I draw come alive on somebodys skin\n","However there is no doubt that the vast majority of Japanese perceive tattoos as a mark of criminality And that has not washed off over time \n","In ancient times the indigenous people of Hokkaido the Ainu practiced tattooing with ink made from the indigo plant The people in the islands to the far south of mainland Japan then the Ryukyu Kingdom but now incorporated into Japan as Okinawa Prefecture also applied skin art inspired by their environment and culture\n","During the Edo period between 1603 and 1867 rule over the nation became more centralized and the punishment for certain types of crimes was tattooing\n","Thieves were tattooed and a murderer had a mark permanently added to his or her face Unsurprisingly tattoos became synonymous with criminals even though there was the parallel development of decorative tattoos and the emergence of a distinctive artistic genre \n","Tattoos were outlawed entirely in the early years of the Meiji period which began in 1868 It was believed that elaborate markings would shock or offend foreigners as Japan opened its borders and sent political and

industry 10.07.2023 ****\"\n","Even though Berlin Fashion Week  takes place twice every year in January and now from July 1013 the German city doesnt exactly hold the title of the capital of fashion \n","Thats why even Berliners are surprised when they find out that their city used to be a thriving fashion hub before World War II And it was mainly thanks to Jewish entrepreneurs who were pioneers of modern fashion in Berlin\n","The clothing industry took off in Berlin in the 1830s Industrial sewing machines introduced in the 1850s were a game changer A shirt could be made in one hour instead of eight\n","Amid this industrialization process Germanys social and political context allowed Jewish entrepreneurs to set the tone \n","For centuries Jewish people living in Germany had been suffering from legal restrictions that affected their ability to make a livelihood and pushed most of them into poverty Many were peddlers trading in haberdashery and secondhand clothes while wealthy Jews traded in fine fabrics explains Uwe Westphal a freelance journalist and author of Fashion Metropolis Berlin 1836  1939 The Story of the Rise and Destruction of the Jewish Fashion Industry\n","Westphal who has dedicated almost 40 years to researching lecturing and writing about the forgotten Jewish fashion industry in Berlin points out that the Industrial Revolution in the mid19th century was followed by the foundation of the German Empire in 1871 which enshrined new rights for Jews in its constitution allowing the German Jewish population  to thrive\n","In 1871 there were just over 800000 inhabitants in Berlin By the 1920s the German capital became a metropolis with a population of over four million 4 of which were Jewish\n","Jews flocked from rural areas to the big city to look for opportunities Amongst them were tailors seamstresses and entrepreneurs such as David Leib Levin who came from Kningsberg He opened a factory for womens coats and in 1840 was one of the first to use fixed prices for his wares says Westphal\n","Fashion trends from Paris especially haute couture were too expensive for the middle classes and whitecollar workers who were nevertheless increasingly interested in looking fashionable So the Jewish entrepreneurs came up with the idea of producing cheap fashionable clothing according to standardized measures explains Westphal The demand was there and the industry grew rapidly\n","Berlins fashion industry reached its height in the roaring 20s with more than 2700 fashion companies predominantly owned by Jewish families Names such as the Manheimer brothers David Leib Levin Nathan Israel and Hermann Gerson were synonymous with the new and growing trend of readytowear fashion \n","Jewish entrepreneurs quickly adapted to the new needs of the industrial era They had a feeling for what people liked and they had international connections to fabric producers Westphal says\n","The garments were sold in glamorous department stores which were mainly owned by Jewish families too\n","Berlins fashion industry also enjoyed international success and exported to the US the Netherlands England Scandinavia and Argentina Berlin offered cheap stylish and highquality daytoday clothing The ideas for designs were copied straight off from the Parisian couture shows Business was booming\n","Antisemitism and envy of the Jews success in the industry existed from early on But with Hitlers rise to power in 1933 the Jewishowned businesses suffered massive blows starting with the boycott against Jewish stores established on April 1 that same year\n","The companies of Jewish fashion manufacturers were then systematically taken over by members of the Nazi party Jews were soon forbidden to take out bank loans For the clothing companies this was a disaster You couldnt have fashion shows without bank guarantees explains Westphal which is why Jews were forced into making Nazi party members partners in their companies to have access to funds and finally transferring ownership at ridiculously low prices \n","In the November pogroms of 1938 groups of Nazi supporters stormed hundreds of companies on Hausvogteiplatz in the Berlin district of Mitte which was the citys center of Jewish fashion They destroyed everything they could get their hands on Of the 2700 Jewish fashion companies only 24 were left and they too were confiscated by 1940 at the latest says Westphal\n","According to Westphal the Nazis main interest was the real estate around Hausvogteiplatz because the party was looking for new offices\n","Later forced laborers worked in fashion workshops set near concentration camps  \n","Josef Neckermann and Hugo Boss are just two prominent names among several owners of companies who profited greatly from the Nazi forced hostile takeover of Jewish businesses They oversaw production of clothing and military uniforms points out Westphal \n","Berlin fashion designers in the 1950s and 60s were content to have no Jewish competition But by then West Germanys fashion industry had moved from Berlin to Dsseldorf and Munich due to the division of the city The East German state had no real interest in fashion By the 70s Germany had became a minor player in fashion Westphal explains\n","Everything that fashion once was especially in the 1920s  fashion schools the overarching culture between fashion architecture the Bauhaus music the film industry and the visual arts in general  all of that was completely destroyed says Westphal\n","What I find scary is that since 1945 nobody wants to remember this fashion culture Theres no commemoration of the many Jewish fashion designers This stands in stark contrast to many German companies that were deeply involved in the Nazi state and have tried to make good since then says the expert \n","In the early 90s Westphals frustration led to campaigning for a memorial at Hausvogteiplatz with the support of the Jewish community in Berlin In 2000 the memorial was inaugurated with funding by the Berlin government\n","Berlins traditional Jewish fashion industry is long gone but as part of the upcoming Days of Jewish Culture festival a fashion show of contemporary Jewish and Israeli designers will take place on September 7 According to Westphal it is the first Jewish fashion show in the German capital since 1939\n","Edited by Elizabeth Grenier\n","\n","\n","'*** Should Soviet monuments be dismantled or preserved? 09.07.2023 ****'\n","For some Soviet monuments symbolize the Red Armys occupation and the Stalinist regimes repression for others they commemorate the USSRs victory over Nazi Germany in World War II\n","Russias full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 once again fueled the debate in different Eastern European countries including in Latvia and Poland where imposing Soviet monuments such as the Victory Monument in Riga were hastily dismantled\n","In Bulgaria however public opinion is strongly divided on what should be done with the communistera monuments One of the reasons for this division is the lack of historical reappraisal of the communist past As a result a large part of the population still romanticizes this period\n","At the center of the controversy is a memorial complex known as the Monument to the Soviet Army right in the middle of the Bulgarian capital Sofia\n","Over the past decade the association Initiative for Dismantling the Soviet Army Monument has been campaigning to have it removed from the city center\n","The monument was built in 1954 10 years after the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria during a period of suppression of all resistance against the Bulgarian communist regime\n","Following the invasion of the Red Army a communist regime was established in Bulgaria This monument was created under an unfree regime at a time when occupiers called themselves liberators says Marta Georgieva from the Initiative for Dismantling the Soviet Army Monument The association aims to increase the populations awareness for their history through their actions \n","Marta Georgieva also sees parallels between what happened in Bulgaria at the time and what is happening in Ukraine today An army simply invades a country and declares itself a liberator when it wins the war \n","During the Second World War from 1941 to 1944 Bulgaria was on the side of the Axis powers but did not send soldiers to the Eastern Front and refused to declare war on the Soviet Union\n","In August 1944 Bulgaria terminated its pact with NaziGermany and declared neutrality However Bulgarias offer of an armistice was rejected by Moscow and the Soviet Union declared war on Sofia Within the first three months after the Red Armys invasion of Bulgaria on September 9 1944 a communist regime was installed and between 18000 and 30000 people  including clergy journalists former ministers and landowners  were murdered   \n","But people in Bulgaria know too little about this dark chapter of their history Its a gap that needs to be filled  and getting rid of the monument is part of that process according to Marta Georgieva and her team \n","We want this square to be depoliticized because this monument divides us as a society says Kuper Saparev another member of the initiative Because of the monument we cannot use the square it doesnt look to the future but rather serves as criminal propaganda of the past and causes a lot of tension \n","As early as 1993 the city council had decided to dismantle the monument But since then various institutions have been dodging responsibility for its removal\n","Weve proven that this is not a cultural monument and the authorities have confirmed that its not a soldiers memorial says Marta Georgieva\n","Not everybody supports the idea of dismantling the monument\n","In fact there are many people who believe it should rather be preserved This is a joint memorial that must remind us that so many people died in this heinous bloody and ruthless war  people who never wanted the war Their memory must be kept alive says an older women holding a picture of a relative who died in the Second World War She is among a group of people gathered in front of the monument in Sofia at a commemorative event held on May 9 also known as Victory Day Every year the date marking the end of World War II is celebrated in different former communistled countries\n","In the eyes of those who commemorate Victory Day and wave Russian flags in the center of EUmember state Bulgaria the monument serves as a symbol of the fight against fascism  a fight they feel is still ongoing as different people told DW at the commemorative event with some believing the West is the actual aggressor in the current war against Ukraine \n","Putins propaganda narrative falls on fertile ground in Bulgaria a country that has never completely escaped Russian influence The country has not yet come to terms with its past There is too little historical reappraisal and too much disinformation The horrors of the communist era were barely discussed for a long time allowing problematic interpretations of the past to spread \n","A third option for the monument would be to turn it into a museum or relocate it to an existing institution such as Sofias Museum of Art from the Socialist Period which displays various portrayals of Lenin Che Guevara Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov and many other leaders from the communist past \n","During that time art had to serve propaganda It became a tool of political power and ideology The Communist Party melded with the state and this oneparty system controlled every sphere of public political and cultural life Art was not excluded from these processes says curator Nikolai Ushtavaliiski \n","Ushtavaliiski has been director of the museum since 2011 and has followed the debate over the Soviet Army monument in Sofia with interest But as the monument might not fit in the museums football pitchsized park the curator points out that there is another location that is also being considered for it   \n","The monument could be dismantled and relocated to the city of Dimitrovgrad 220 kilometers 137 miles from Sofia he says The interesting aspect there is that this city was founded in the early years of socialism It was built out of nothing Dimitrovgrad became a symbol for the construction of a new socialist society in Bulgaria points out Ushtavaliiski who therefore feels that since Dimitrovgrad itself is a monument to socialism a monument like the one in Sofia which honors a foreign army could find an appropriate place there \n","Edited by Elizabeth Grenier\n","\n","\n","('*** Two rediscovered Rembrandt portraits sell for €11 million at auction '\n","

decorated with a mix of Buddhist and Hindu gods that belong in a temple And why was there superficial techno music playing during the final relaxation phase known as the shavasana\n","Everything was so sterile and fancy Everyone had gym clothes on while I had come in comfy clothes The yoga teacher walked around the room correcting the asanas or postures Lerner recalls She was irritated that she felt disconnected from the teacher and the other practitioners since yoga stands for a sense of community Lerner thought she was doing something wrong that she was not flexible enough and that she needed more practice\n","Today ten years later the 44yearold knows shes not doing anything wrong just like the approximately three million Germans who practice yoga regularly Because its not about right or wrong  its about awareness\n","Yoga is not a sport it doesnt matter what kind of body you have Yoga is healing work  accessible to everyone And for that there must be spaces where everyone can feel welcome Sangeeta Lerner tells DW\n","Originating from India yoga is closely linked to Hindu philosophy and practice In western societies however yoga is often taken out of context and commercialized\n","Lerner sees this as cultural appropriation Under British rule yoga was forbidden Now sacred symbols and practices are unconsciously appropriated and dissociated from their Indian origins\n","Sometimes everyday life doesnt provide enough opportunities to laugh so laughing yoga makes up for that The course starts with a rather artificial laughing exercise consisting of hohoho and hahaha Real giggling is supposed to automatically ensue Laughing yoga which eases tensions and strengthens the immune system is the easiest form of yoga  and is a good option for

yoga without being culturally appropriative Both experienced yoga teachers and beginners attend these twoday workshops\n","Are you taking yoga away from us now is one of the questions Lerner often hears Of course not is her answer As someone who grew up with it she mainly wants to create awareness of its complexity and pass on its cultural roots\n","We all live in toxic cultures whether in

locked cabinet and the keys had been left with an officer who was not onboard the ship Part of the crew had been replaced shortly before the first Atlantic crossing and this officer was among those replaced He must have forgotten to leave the key on the ship\n","Once the Titanic hit the iceberg and it was clear the ship would sink chaos reigned and the air was filled with fear and the screams of passengers scrambling to board lifeboats\n","The liners musicians however decided to play on the deck of the luxury liner For more than two hours after the collision the band was still trying to calm down the frightened people onboard All eight musicians lost their lives in the accident This moving gesture by the band can be seen in director James Camerons 1997 cult film Titanic\n","None of the

sea that night had a temperature of around 0 degrees Celsius 32 degrees Fahrenheit a temperature in which a person could normally only survive for a maximum of 15 minutes\n","Charles Joughin the chief

swimming in the water he was pulled onto an overturned lifeboat and was eventually picked up by a rescue ship\n","The love story of Rose and Jack featured in James Camerons Titanic is pure fiction But there were lovers on the Titanic who suffered a tragic end\n","One example is the coowner of the American department store Macys and his wife Isidor and Ida Straus They had spent the winter in Europe and were on their way back home to New York Both were offered a seat in a lifeboat but Isidor refused  as long as children and women were still on the sinking ship he did not want to get on\n","His wife Ida in turn did not want to be rescued without her husband and is reported to have said I will not be separated from my husband As we have lived so will we die together Several plaques commemorate the couple who chose to share death including one at Macys department store in New York City\n","The ship should have had 32 lifeboats and while the initial designer planned for this the shipping company was convinced that the liner was safe and that having more lifeboats would just needlessly take up space on the decks On a ship like this comfort was of the utmost importance\n","The company actually did not violate any safety laws because according to the regulations of the time the number of boats was based on the weight of the ship not on the number of passengers It was a fatal calculation With the 16 lifeboats and four folding boats that were onboard only 700 people could be rescued\n","Perhaps before naming the steamer Titanic the White Star Line shipping company should have read author Morgan Robertsons book Futility published in 1898\n","The novel told the story of a large and luxurious ship called the Titan that hits an iceberg while sailing between the US and England  just like the Titanic in real life\n","Many individuals set out to find the sunken Titanic but it was not until 73 years after the disaster in 1985 that underwater archaeologist Robert Ballard succeeded in locating the wreck in the North Atlantic and photographing it for the first time He financed this endeavor by agreeing to search for the remains of two sunken submarines in a secret US Navy mission He then had 12 days in which he was allowed to use Navy equipment to find the Titanic\n","At a depth of 3800 meters 12470 feet in eternal darkness he found the wreck of the former luxury liner The find came just in time as microbes had already settled onto the shipwreck and begun decomposing the Titanic piece by piece it will eventually become dust Scientists suspect that the wreck will be gone by 2030 Yet the legend will certainly remain\n","The bestknown film adaptation of the Titanic story is probably James Camerons 1997 boxoffice hit The film is considered one of the most successful films in movie history  it won 11 Oscars\n","But there were also other film adaptations The first was made in 1912 the same year the steamer went down It was entitled Saved From the Titanic and the main role was played by a survivor of the disaster\n","A Titanic film was also made in Germany during World War II but the Nazis used this film version as a propaganda tool against the US and the United Kingdom\n","Since 1912 many passenger ships have cruised the Atlantic and the Titanic has long since been overtaken in size by countless other vessels The largest cruise ship launched in 2022 is called Wonder of the Seas It has a width of 66 meters 216 feet compared to the Titanics 28 meters There is also a clear difference in height the Wonder of the Seas measures 725 meters and the Titanic just 53 meters\n","\n","This article was originally written in German\n","\n","\n","'*** Bach Festival 2023: Cantatas for eternity 19.06.2023 ****'\n","When Johann Sebastian

contemporaries It is also more complex to grasp that people back then may simply have been overwhelmed Maul says\n","Bach is also said to have expected too much of his Thomaner boys at times He complained to the council about the caliber of the boys who had been chosen and after a few years  also because of other differences with the city council  he increasingly turned to secular

in presentday Tanzania The skeleton has thrilled school classes and visitors to Berlin since it was first displayed in 1937 but few are aware of its history\n","The dinosaur is also on the travel list of Tanzanian historian Philemon Mtoi who believes the skeleton came to Berlin illegally This animal is not originated from Germany So I think it should be displayed in its country of origin Mtoi said adding that it was one of the very special animals in the world\n","It will attract a lot of people A lot of people are coming to see the display of this animal in the Berlin museum It does not

concrete when it comes to artifacts With regard to the repatriation of human remains and the return of cultural property there are offers of negotiations and the German government is in favor of a dialogue with the Tanzanian government in this regard\n","One of Dagdelens central questions however remains unanswered She had asked whether German colonial troops bloody suppression of the Maji Maji rebellion in southeastern Tanganyika could be described as genocide from todays perspective\n","A precedent for this is Germanys official acknowledgment in 2021 that it committed genocide during its colonial occupation of Namibia when it massacred the Herero and Nama peoples in the early 1900s\n","Between 1905 and 1907 the Germans quashed the Maji Maji uprising with extreme brutality using

dialogue She also wants the government to learn from its mistakes in dealing with Namibia\n","While both Germany and Namibia have made a joint declaration about the Herero and Nama genocide the Namibian government is yet to ratify it Thats because the descendants of the genocide victims want direct reparations rather than the 11 billion 12 billion promised to the Namibian government\n","From the beginning the German government in close coordination with the government of Tanzania should also genuinely take into account the descendants of the victims or the communities particularly affected by the genocide and seek dialogue Dagdelen said\n","Historian Jrgen Zimmerer believes the German government is avoiding the issue because it is worried about setting a precedent\n","People are afraid of precedents when they officially acknowledge colonial violence in connection with reparations or apologies he told DW noting that there are demands for reparations from World War II So the outcomes of ongoing debates on recognizing colonial injustice are being watched very closely\n","The German government thought it could sweep Namibia under the rug but it cant do that he said And

way\n","The Left Partys parliamentary question also raises the reparations issue The German governments answer There has so far been no official demand from the Tanzanian government\n","Tanzanian

years that a major work by Picasso went up for auction in Germany \n","The painting of Roque was originally from her estate but was auctioned on behalf of a German private collector\n","Picasso and

Balasore eastern Odisha has once again focused attention on the issue of railway safety in India\n","The crash was one of the countrys deadliest train accidents in decades and occurred at a time when the government has been trying to make rail travel a pleasurable and more importantly safe experience\n","Such crashes are far from unprecedented in India In 1999 a collision between two trains in West Bengal killed 285 people and in 2010 145 died in the same state when a passenger train derailed and was hit by a cargo train More recently in 2016 160 people died when a passenger train traveling between the cities of Indore and Patna slipped off its tracks\n","For the last few years the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to stimulate its rail modernization push by introducing highspeed automated trains in one of the largest and busiest rail networks in the world This includes a plan to have 100 electrification of the railways by 2024 and make the network carbonneutral by 2030\n","Earlier this year German engineering giant Siemens received a huge order to manufacture 1200 electric trains while Japanese expertise has been commissioned to provide technology and finance to assist in the construction of the first bullet train a 508kilometer 316mile link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad\n","But experts have blamed crumbling infrastructure for causing numerous train accidents raising questions about the money spent on train maintenance and track renewal\n","Indian Railways considered to be the lifeline of the nation with between 13 to 14 million employees and carries around 23 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight every day Over 21000 trains work on a broadgauge network of some 68000 kilometers 42000 miles\n","However according to an assessment by the governments comptroller and auditor general 163 of the 217 consequential train accidents from 2017 to 2018 and 2020 to 2021 were caused by derailments accounting for around 75 of accidents\n","The report submitted to parliament last December said a major factor in these accidents was the lack of maintenance on railway tracks Funds for track renewal had declined the report said and in many cases were not being fully utilized\n","Fires accidents at unmanned level crossings and collisions were the other causes of accidents cited by the report What is more concerns have been flagged on the acute shortage of manpower especially in track safety with many posts lying vacant in departments across the network\n","Though the cause of the Odisha accident is still being investigated officials have hinted that the likely reason was a signaling error that led the Chennaibound Coromandel Express to fatally change tracks causing it to ram into a stationary freight train\n","\n","From the nature of the accident it was caused by an error in the electronic signaling system that led a train to wrongly change tracks a senior railway official requesting anonymity told DW The passenger train entered another loop line and crashed into a goods train\n","There was no anticollision device on the train as far as I know Mamata Banerjee West Bengal chief minister and a former railway minister told the Indian media Had the device been on the train this would not have happened\n","The new antitrain collision system named Kavach causes trains to brake automatically but it has only been operational on 2 of the vast rail network\n","The Kavach system is designed to help train operators avoid signal passing and overspeeding while also providing support for train operations during adverse weather conditions such as dense fog By automatically applying brakes when necessary the system ensures better control over train speed\n","If the Modi government has effected a quantum increase in modernization and expansion of the rail network with an unprecedented increase in capital expenditure has investment in safety increased proportionately said M K Venu an economic analyst speaking with DW\n","The initial development of Kavach began in 2012 and was completed last year But less than 5 billion Indian rupees 565 million605 million was allocated to install the system last year when estimates suggested that a trillion rupees would have been necessary to cover the entire railway network This years budget has brought a windfall for railways with 29 billion allocated for railway development the highest ever\n","Apparently realizing that the railways have a huge multiplier effect on the economy the government is now planning to double lines more quickly convert nearly the entire network to broadgauge introduce highpowered locomotives and complete electrification projects All of these measures are expected to increase Indian Railways line capacity\n","India has also rolled out the highspeed automated Vande Bharat trains equipped with stateoftheart passenger amenities that provide a faster and more convenient travel experience\n","The government intends to introduce nearly 400 Vande Bharat trains during the next five years and manufacture hydrogenpowered ecofriendly Vande Metro trains to replace old trains designed in the 1950s and 60s\n","A lot more still needs to be done to upgrade the 65000 kilometers more than 40300 miles of tracks and install modern signaling equipment on the network For now the train accident in eastern Odisha is a stark reminder of the obstacles facing the government in delivering on its promise to make the railways more efficient and safer\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Edited by Ben

Biennale at which architects from all over the world will congregate presents 63 national pavilions in the old brick halls of the Arsenale the former shipyard and naval base of the former Republic of Venice \n","This years installment is dominated by climate change issues and a reappraisal of the colonial era Its about questions of production resources and representation said chief curator Lesley Naa Norle Lokko at a press conference ahead of the event Its about change\n","And change is much needed According to UN predictions the worlds population will grow from its current 8 billion to 10 billion by 2050 In subSaharan Africa alone the population could double Thats incredible said Peter Cachola Schmal architecture expert and director of the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt The fact is that these people will need  and want  a roof over their heads\n","For this reason Lokko has deliberately focused on the African continent The GhanaianScottish architect university lecturer and bestselling novelist curated the shows central exhibition  and invited 55 offices from around the world with many from Africa or having African roots\n","The consequences of global warming resource consumption and migration are especially visible on the continent and its where Lokko sees the greatest challenges for architecture Africa is the continent with the worlds youngest population and the fastest urbanization  with 4 annual growth that often happens at the expense of local ecosystems All of this puts Africa at the forefront of climate change said Lokko\n","There is no doubt that Africa has a huge need for construction The question is how to build in times of climate change the construction and operation of buildings accounts for about 40 of climatedamaging emissions according to the WWF Cement production alone accounts for about 8 of greenhouse gases worldwide\n","That poses a dilemma What does it mean for the worlds CO2 management if unimaginable quantities of cement are produced in Africa all at once asked architecture expert Schmal in a DW interview The future contradicts all our goals of saving the world from climate collapse \n","There is also the very practical question Who is going to build the 1 billion housing units needed to accommodate all the people flocking to the growing megacities Who if not China\n","For years Chinas strategy has been to build African infrastructure said Schmal adding that the Chinese can do it In China they have shown they can produce infrastructure  housing construction transportation  for tens of millions of people within a few years he said They have the experience that we dont have he argued The West slept through that\n","Whether the Venice Architecture Biennale is a wakeup call remains to be seen The show certainly presents as a showcase of ideas curated for the first time by a woman who grew up in Africa and who likely has different perspective on global architecture\n","Lokko born in 1964 is widely traveled She grew up in Accra the capital of  Ghana and moved to the United Kingdom to study Hebrew and Arabic at Oxford University She then studied architecture in London where she earned her doctorate Over her decadeslong career she has taught on four continents\n","Lokko is also a bestselling author having published novels over the past 20 years that set a political and moral bar for contemporary events from Sundowners in 2003 to Soul Sisters in 2021 Many of her books explore the lives of Black women in all corners of the world\n","The architect has two buzzwords for her colleagues concerning the debate about the future  decarbonization and decolonization lowering CO2 emissions and overcoming the legacy of colonization respectively Both are likely to be discussed at the Venice architecture show As was the case at last years documenta 15 the worlds largest art exhibition based in the German city of Kassel the voice of the Global South will also be heard loud and clear in Venice\n","The future of the planet will be decided in Africa said Peter Cachola Schmal Living conditions for people in subSaharan Africa must be adequate he warned adding it would be wise to help support the effort Otherwise more refugees could be headed to Europe The West must prepare he said\n","Sustainability is the focus of the German pavilion at the Biennale under the motto Open for Maintenance  Open due to Reconstruction jointly curated by Summacumfemmer ARCH and Bro Juliane Greb They took over the pavilion as designed by Berlinbased artist Maria Eichhorn for last years

work\n","DW You are the first African at the head of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt a cultural institution of great renown Do you think this is still worth mentioning or has Germany overcome the stereotypes that might have prevented such an appointment in the past\n","The truth is that I am the only African who is the director of such an institution in Germany That means its not completely normal yet Things can still be improved We have to keep working on that and in a few years I hope it wont be a rarity anymore\n","Do you think that as an African as a Cameroonian your programming you have planned for the Haus der Kulturen der Welt is different from that which would be planned by a German director\n","Of course Because knowledge is embodied\n","As a Cameroonian as someone who grew up in Bamenda as an African I carry with me different knowledge different philosophies I speak different languages\n","I think that the program we are going to propose will indeed be different\n","And above all its not just about me because I managed to form a team of almost 15 exhibition curators who come from different parts of the world who will also bring different knowledge They come from Asia South America Africa the United States and Europe And that of course will influence our program\n","You are a specialist in biotechnology by training but you nevertheless began to take an interest in art and culture at an early age Did you first avoid becoming an art historian for financial reasons\n","Ive had an interest in art since my childhood But when I came to Germany it was clear that I couldnt study art history  because in my context in Cameroon its not something that gives you work afterwards\n","So how did you get into the arts\n","Already in Cameroon I was very close to the artists This means that I started my art studies when I was maybe 17 or 18 when I went to Yaound to study But afterwards in Berlin after my studies we had the opportunity to meet artists and it started like that\n","My father was an anthropologist and therefore when I was little there were quite a few books by writers like Aim Csaire Walter Rodney or Jomo Kenyatta as well as many other publications and especially the works of Lopold Sdar Senghor So I have learned the postcolonial critical discourse already from my childhood\n","You are sometimes described as an intransigent militant against colonialism Does this have to do with the fact that your father was an anthropologist\n","I wouldnt call myself a militant for any cause  because I dont like the word militant I rather see myself as an advocate for the things that I find important in society\n","What is your position regarding the return of looted works to Africa\n","It is very clear that I would like to see the objects that were taken from Africans Asians Native Americans or other parts of the world returned to their original context I would love to see a world where people are reunited with their sacred objects and their history\n","What does this mean exactly\n","It means that colonial history has really created destruction all over the world And that people have lost their history Restitution means to return but it also means to heal what has been destroyed I think you cant do decolonization without healing without restitution and without reparation and without rehabilitation Thats why Im getting involved\n","I repeat Im not a militant But Im passionate about it because we have to take our history into our own hands To move forward in this world that is so destabilized where there are a lot of imbalances we have to restore harmony And my project is a humanistic project to find harmony in the world\n","Does the healing process also involve apologies\n","Apologies are a starting point but not the end\n","When you give an apology you look at the wounds you have made It is an acknowledgment of what has been done You can admit that you hurt people that you recognize it and apologize But thats not enough because the injury is still there\n","What can we do to heal these wounds\n","We need to engage in this process of healing which really means restoring what has been destroyed And in fact restitution  I really want to emphasize this  is not only about returning works but is also about the restitution of knowledge and the restitution of the dignity of human beings\n","One of the greatest evils that has been inflicted in the context of colonization is the dehumanization of human beings And we have to do exercises of rehumanization of reestablishing this humanity that we have destroyed\n","How can we restore this dignity in a very concrete way\n","Very concretely there are several paths that can be taken We need to accept that there is no gradient between human beings and that all human beings have the right to be what they want to be\n","This interview was originally conducted in French\n","\n","\n","\n","'*** How supermodel Heidi Klum built a multimillion-euro empire

student was found guilty of founding a criminal organization and committing six serious attacks on neoNazis in an unusual case of violent leftwing extremism in Germany\n","She was sentenced to five years and three months in prison but was later told she would only have to return to jail if she also loses an appeal Her three male codefendants were sentenced to around three years in prison each\n","The defendants were greeted on Wednesday with a huge round of applause many of them waving and smiling to friends and relatives in the courtroom in Dresden When Lina E herself was brought in the applause was even louder and longer with virtually the whole of the gallery apart from the journalists standing up\n","As soon as the sentence was read the gallery began chanting leftist messages of support The judge called for quiet so he could read out his reasoning saying Anyone who is interested in hearing why the verdict was the way it was can stay Someone immediately shouted Because youre fascist friends Others called out Fing class justice\n","The judge immediately called a 15minute break during which people who had shouted were to be removed by security\n","\n","There were loud groans of protest and tuts of disgust from the gallery throughout the reading of the courts reasoning The judge said that even if the political motivations of the defendants such as fighting rightwing extremism could be regarded as justified that did not reduce the severity of their crimes He also criticized the defense lawyers for describing the trial as political justice\n","The judge also took time to defend the German justice system mentioning the number of convictions against violent farright extremists that this court had itself handed down in the past few years Again this was greeted with scoffing and sarcastic laughter from the gallery\n","However late on Wednesday evening as the proceedings were drawing to a close the judge gave the defendants supporters in the courtroom a reason to cheer instead \n","After spending an exhausting day reading the courts entire reasoning which took upwards of eight hours including breaks presiding judge Hans SchlterStaats did have one more surprise By now audibly hoarse after recounting the details of the police investigation in painstaking detail the judge declared in the evening that Lina E would be freed until the conviction was upheld \n","Provided she gives up her passport and ID and reports to the police twice a week Lina E will be allowed to return home until any appeals are exhausted If she does return to prison she will have only around three years of her fiveyear sentence to serve since she has been in custody since her arrest\n","  \n","State prosecutors said Lina E and her three codefendants  Lennart A Philipp M and Jannis R  carried out a series of attacks on neoNazis in the eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony between 2018 and 2020 including two attacks on Leon R a notorious farright extremist who was himself arrested for allegedly forming a farright extremist organization\n","The group around Lina E is believed to have raided a wellknown neoNazi bar in the town of Eisenach in late 2019 and attacked Leon R with hammers and batons When the initial attack failed the group attacked him again a few weeks later outside his car Other neoNazis were left with broken bones and other injuries after the attacks\n","Much of the prosecutions case rested on the testimony of a member of her group who turned states witness thirtyyearold Johannes D who said before the Dresden Higher Regional Court that the four defendants had trained specifically for attacks on rightwing extremists But later allegedly said that it was merely a matter of normal martial arts training for physical exercise \n","The level of planning was key to the prosecutions case as the accusation that Lina E was the leader of a criminal organization rested on arguments that the attacks were specially trained for \n","The case has created plenty of political tension with the defense and farleft scenes in Lina Es home city of Leipzig saying that she has been scapegoated as a leftwing terrorist by both the media and the authorities Many allege that the justice system is too lenient on neoNazi perpetrators\n","Free Lina signs and collection boxes for her defense fund have been put out in the Leipzig district of Connewitz a leftwing hub where Lina E herself lived \n","But Hendrik Hansen a specialist in extremism and professor at the Federal University of Applied Administrative Sciences argues that the media has if anything underestimated the dangers of leftwing extremism\n","This trial is a clear success Hansen told DW In the area around Leipzig we are facing the rise of clandestine structures that are very well networked in the leftwing extremist scene and who are using methods that they have not used before\n","Hansen said Lina Es group could clearly be classified as a criminal organization and could well be described as terrorist This was a whole group of people planning attacks so minutely that they were using the appropriate technology like disposable mobile phones They had scouts who spied on the victims The tasks within the group were very precisely divided up\n","Hansen said that the evidence showed that the group was not merely planning streetfighting methods but targeted assaults aimed at seriously injuring or even killing their victims Terrorism is defined as using politically motivated violence to spread fear and horror either within the general population or within a certain group of people he said\n","Lina E was born in Kassel central Germany she showed interest in a career as a social worker working with disadvantaged youth and during her studies wrote about how to deal with farright radicalization among young people\n","Kassel is located in the state of Hesse which has a large farright scene and in 2006 the city was the scene of one of the 10 murders

meaning literally stumbling stone or metaphorically stumbling block \n","Each of the brass plaques embedded in pavements recalls the fate of a person who was persecuted by the Nazis deported murdered or driven to suicide\n","Gunter Demnig and his team place the plaques on sidewalks in front of the last address where victims of Nazi persecution lived voluntarily So far 100000 Stolpersteine have been installed in 27 European countries\n","The latest Stolperstein installed on May 26 honors Johann Wild a firefighter from Nuremberg He was executed for writing letters in which he denounced the Nazi regime\n","Demnig launched his project in Cologne in 1996 illegally without official permission\n","The first plaque was placed on the anniversary of the socalled Auschwitz Decree issued by Heinrich Himmler one of the main people responsible for the Holocaust\n","With the decree the former Reichsfhrer SS ordered the deportation of all Sinti and Roma living in the German Reich Demnigs Stolpersteine are a private form of remembrance separate from the state culture of remembrance in Germany  \n","The Stolpersteine are my lifes work says the 75yearold sculptor He lives with his wife Katja in central Hesse western Germany His trademark is a widebrimmed brown cowboy hat In the beginning he laid the 10by10centimeter 4by4 inch cubes himself but now other people are getting involved The names and fates of the victims are engraved on the brass plaques\n","The artist remembers many of the stories behind the plaques At one laying ceremony two sisters came he says One came from Colombia the other from Scotland Both had been saved by the Kindertransport an organized rescue effort for children from Nazicontrolled territory but their parents were murdered They hadnt seen each other in 60 years and said Now were reunited with our parents Demnig says covering his eyes with his hand and fighting back tears Such encounters have made him realize the meaning of his initiative he adds\n","These days the new Stolpersteine are initiated by historical societies citizens initiatives or school projects A plaque costs 132 142 inclusing having it laid\n","The idea behind the Stolpersteine is that people walking along will see the bronze plaque and stop curious to know whom it commemorates and what happened to them Thats the effect Demnig hopes to achieve The artist is convinced that theres a difference between a teenager opening a book and reading about 6 million murdered Jews and them learning about the fate of a family while standing where they lived\n","But some people including representatives of Jewish organizations are critical of the project Charlotte Knobloch a leader of the Jewish community in Munich says that by putting the plaques in the pavement Demnig is allowing the victims fates to literally be stepped all over\n","The artist rejects that criticism out of hand calling it an unspeakable counterargument He says that statements of that kind trivialize Nazi atrocities and mock the victims The Nazis werent content to simply trample their victims They had a targeted extermination program says Demnig\n","The originator of the Stolpersteine wont let the objections to his project  which even go as far as death threats  deter him from continuing his mission\n","Gunter Demnig says he wants to call attention to Nazi crimes wherever they were committed And he wants to give the victims of the Holocaust back their names and their dignity and make sure they will not be forgotten\n","This article was originally written in

for Adolf Hitlers New Reich Chancellery in Berlin\n","Now the sculptures will be shown again for the first time in the Spandau Citadel One of the horses has been on display there for some time and the second one is now being unveiled and examined by restorers\n","On the Day of the Open Monument on September 10 2023 it will be permanently presented again for the first time according to the museum along with other problematic works of art\n","Commissioned by Hitler at the height of his power the colossal twin Striding Horses had stood in the garden of Hitlers seat of government from 1939 to 1943 They were part of the thousands of bronze works crafted for the Nazi regime in its quest to transform Berlin into the imperial global capital of Germania\n","Josef Thorak was born in Vienna on February 7 1889 and attended the Vienna Art Academy eventually moving on to the Berlin Art Academy in 1915 After his studies he established himself as a sculptor of monumental works such as the 4meterhigh 13foot gable figure for the Reichsbank building in the western German city of Buer\n","His style secured him numerous government commissions and he became known internationally when he worked on among others the Security Monument in Ankara Turkey in 1934\n","From 1937 onward Thorak became one of the preferred sculptors of the Nazis commissioned to create countless propaganda sculptures emphasizing the supposed strength and glory of the regime\n","While Hitler and his regime persecuted Jewish and modern artists who they claimed produced degenerate art and looted the collections of Jewish art collectors Thorak flourished He divorced his Jewish wife and accepted a prestigious position at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts After the end of World War II he continued to create unchallenged until his death in 1952\n","The Striding Horses were only rediscovered in 2015 after a spectacular raid on an underground art trading ring operating in Germany Police secured the horse statues as well as sculptures by Fritz Klimsch and Arno Breker two more of Hitlers favorite artists\n","The works were probably intended to be sold on the black market because Nazi art remains taboo on the official market as art historian Christian Fuhrmeister told DW in 2015 There are some private collectors in Germany in the US or in Russia there are people who are enthusiastic about it he said\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","According to the official website of the Spandau Citadel a former Renaissance fortress turned exhibition space the purpose of displaying the sculptures is to illuminate how the respective state powers wanted to shape the Berlin cityscape through the monuments they commissioned The collection features monuments created from 1849 to 1986 covering the German Reich the Weimar Republic Nazi Germany and East Germany\n","Stating on its website that the sculptures are testimonies to German history the museum has deemed the featured monuments important symbols of German history The adjective important may raise some eyebrows but the museum explains it is aiming to transform itself into a center for the study of toxic monuments The federal government has also supported the acquisition of the Striding Horses \n"," \n","Previously the display of Nazi art has led to fierce protest Last year the Pinakothek in Munich was slammed in an open letter for displaying a painting by Adolf Ziegler another Nazi artist Georg Baselitz one of the worlds most influential living artists called for it to be removed \n","It is shocking that Nazi propaganda is possible in this grubby way in a Munich museum Baselitz wrote last October He added that it was unbearable that works by artists who were persecuted by the Nazis hung next to the work of an artist responsible for their persecution\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","In fact plenty of Nazi propaganda sculptures remain in public spaces such as in Berlins Olympic Stadium commissioned by the Nazi regime for the 1936 Olympics Ahead of the World Cup in 2006 for which the stadium was one of the venues some activists called for the removal of its statues However the city refused on the grounds that a removal would be a denial of Germanys history\n","Edited by Brenda Haas\n","\n","\n","'*** Reclaiming the history of Ukrainian art 28.05.2023 ****'\n","On a Monday afternoon in Cologne Ukrainian curator Yuliia Berdiiarova meets me at the rear entrance of Museum Ludwig The museum next to the main train station and Cologne cathedral is closed to the public on Mondays\n","Berdiiarova a 29yearold art historian worked at the Odesa Fine Arts Museum and the Mystetskyi Arsenal in Kyiv before the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n","In her role at Museum Ludwig she has organized a school vacation program for Ukrainian refugee children and their parents She also conducts research into Ukrainian modernism which had previously been falsely attributed to the Russian avantgarde\n","Berdiiarova offers to show me some of the artworks that will be displayed from June 3 as part of the exhibition Modernism in Ukraine 19001930s The curator has been part of the Museum Ludwig team for almost a year and shes helping to prepare this show\n","Many of the works in this extensive exhibition previously on show in Madrid were removed from Ukraine due to the war and had never before been displayed outside the country The exhibition is completed by works that have been taken out of Museum Ludwigs storage\n","We take the stairs to the first floor and walk through the museum which is mostly empty Berdiiarova says museums without people make her sad A lot of museums in Ukraine are still closed she says Its a place for dialogue sometimes Its a place for relief to feel connection with history to feel connection with other people\n","Even in Cologne Russias war in Ukraine is everpresent for Berdiiarova But she knows shes one of the lucky ones Her position at Museum Ludwig and her stay in Cologne are financed by three different foundations But last June when she left Odesa where shed worked as a museum curator for six years she didnt know what was next She took a step into the unknown\n","It was a very hard decision to leave Odesa she says I dont want to call it an adventure because adventure is something good but it was not an adventure in a good way It was just like a step into nothing I had a really small bag That was all\n","That bag contained nothing more than her documents ID and the most essential clothes Berdiiarova has since had some of her clothes sent to her from Ukraine and before me stands a stylish woman all in black A turtleneck top a suit sunglasses She says with a wink that she tries to look the part of a typical museum curator inspired by the famous Kasimir Malevich painting Black Square\n","Berdiiarova would have preferred to stay in Ukraine She says that in the first few months of the war she and her colleagues initially took works from the museum in Odesa to safety but then life there became impossible\n","She fled across to Warsaw from where she continued first to Berlin then to Cologne Ukrainian colleagues sent her information about a program for Ukrainian curators in Germany from the Ernst Siemens Foundation\n","She hasnt abandoned her homeland in Cologne on the contrary she says shes fighting in her own way with words At Museum Ludwig shes corrected all the names of Ukrainian artists First we freed the spelling of the cities from their Russian spelling That was part of the Soviet Unions culture of appropriation to Russify names of cities and people We made Kharkov into Kharkiv again The names were transliterated from the Russian alphabet into the Latin alphabet And Im very proud that Museum Ludwig agreed to the corrections\n","So the Ukrainian artist Alexander Bogomazov is now Oleksandr Bohomazov and the Ukrainian capital is now spelled Kyiv\n","The war has now helped familiarize the public with Ukraine and its art history  thanks in part to Berdiiarovas work She combed through the Museum Ludwigs collection and not only came across names of Ukrainian artists whose names still had the Russian spellings she also corrected national affiliations\n","Kazimir Malevich for instance had a Ukrainian passport during the Soviet era where it was written that he was Ukrainian Berdiiarova adds that he spent a significant portion of his career as a professor at the Kyiv Academy of Arts and published texts in Ukrainian magazines She says that Malevichs Ukrainian identity was suppressed so he was always considered a representative of the Russian avantgarde\n","Other Ukrainian artists like Vasyl Yermilov were also coopted by the Russian avantgarde The artist was born in Kharkiv in 1894 but was considered a representative of the Russian Constructivist movement Now on the initiative of Yuliia Berdiiarova his works hang in a new context  alongside works by Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich Late but justice all the same Berdiiarova says proudly \n","We are trying to understand how the concept of the Russian avantgarde was part of the system of appropriation of culture in the postimperialist area and why it has so much power she said Why was the imperialist background of the Soviet Union overlooked for so long in the first place These are all very long processes\n","So along with numerous colleagues she is compiling a list of all the Ukrainian artists in collections worldwide The list is intended to prove how diverse the Ukrainian art landscape has been and how Russian propaganda denied it a place in art history\n","Even though she feels at home in Cologne  and the modern Crane Houses along the Rhine remind her of motifs from constructivist paintings as she recounts with a smile  she also feels very lonely So she wants to return to Odesa when her program ends even though the war will probably not be over by then Odesa is my home Its just too hard to be so far away Sometimes it feels safer to be with your people even when bombs are falling\n","\n","\n","'*** Museums struggle to embrace diversity in new documentary 27.05.2023 ****'\n","In December 2019 Rein Wolfs took over as director of the renowned Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and quickly set about making its collection and staff more diverse and inclusive\n","Along for the ride was filmmaker Sarah Vos who for three years captured this pioneering effort by a major cultural institution to effect greater diversity in its halls    \n","Her camera observed as Wolfs formerly the director of the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn in Germany worked with museum staff to evaluate the range of the collection and the exhibition concepts\n","The sobering conclusion was that less than 10 of works in the collection are by women Works by artists who were Black Indigenous or People of Color BIPOC were rarely seen\n","The resulting documentary White Balls on Walls not only questions the level of diversity in the museum but goes deeper to understand the function of art in society\n","In the past cultural institutions had not thought enough outside the box Wolfs told DW\n","By contrast Amsterdams Stedelijk Museum  now wants to think more globally and for instance align its diversity concept with the population structure of Amsterdam\n","After all we want everyone to have the opportunity to also find their own history and their own moments of identification he said \n","The discussion about a new concept raises questions Can and should diversity be quantified through words or quotas Should the origin and gender of artists play a role in the evaluation of art \n","The Stedelijk team agreed on a quota From 2021 to 2024 at least 50 of the acquisition budget should be spent on works by BIPOC artists There are no fixed quotas for works by women but gender is a factor in the selection process\n","Moreover there is at least one large annual exhibition of BIPOC artists or a group exhibition that addresses diversity Wolf said\n","Diversity plays an inherent role in ethnological museums featuring artifacts and art from all over the world including at Frankfurts Museum of World Cultures \n","The museum focuses on the art of Indigenous people who are themselves minorities in their home countries museum director Eva Raabe said Works by women children and queer people are a further focus of the collection and exhibits  \n","Raabe said it wasnt not about specific quotas but rather about the statement artists want to make with their works\n","Through their art which is an expression of their opinions their needs their lives they tell us about the reality of their lives she said\n","By including a wide variety of perspectives the selection is inherently diverse she adds \n","Meanwhile Berliins KINDL  Centre for Contemporary Art strives for a highly diversified exhibition program director Kathrin Becker told DW \n","I also have a personal mission here which I share with many colleagues in Berlin and elsewhere and that is to achieve a multitude of voices in the presentation of contemporary art Becker said \n","Gender identity as well as ethnic and socioeconomic background are important in this regard she added\n","\n","So how are artists responding to the debate about diversity in art and museums Whom do quotas actually help\n","I would find it almost insulting if the Stedelijk were to do an exhibition of my work just because they are looking for BIPOC artistsSurinameseDutch artist Remy Jungerman says in White Balls on Walls\n","Wolfs however said he was not aware of artists not wanting to exhibit their work at the Stedelijk because of the quotas \n","But the museum director is not surprised by criticism of Stedelijks strategy for more inclusivity and has heard accusations that the museum is putting its political agenda before art\n","Were seen as woke and thats a dirty word these days We get a lot of praise but we also get a lot of criticism he said But thats kind of a part of this institution were a museum thats always very much on the front lines\n","The museum director sees a shift toward more diversity almost everywhere not only in museums but in cultural policy and in social movements\n","Kathrin Becker of Berlins KINDL  Centre for Contemporary Art said museum directors were increasingly trying to counter very Western and Eurocentric collections with new ideas including by inviting artists who dont represent Western art \n","So how can museums become more diverse\n","Whether diversity in the museum is ensured with quotas is achieved through dialogue with artists or is created in multiperspective exhibitions awareness of the issue appears to be driving change\n","As Eva Raabe of Frankfurts Museum of World Cultures surmises You can actually always do more to give smaller groups a voice\n","\n","\n","'*** US charges 2 over Chinese plot against Falun

Henry Kissinger turns 100 26.05.2023 '\n"," '****')\n","After a visit to the Palace of Versailles outside of Paris in the 1970s journalists asked Henry Kissinger what it was like in the majestic Hall of Mirrors to which he responded it was wonderful as he was surrounded by genius\n","For supporters Henry Kissinger is indeed a diplomatic genius who continues to master the art of discerning the politically achievable like no other For critics he is a  war criminal For most he and his political legacy fall somewhere in between\n","During Kissingers time first as a foreign policy adviser and later as secretary of state to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford he contributed to ending the Vietnam War entering a dtente with the Soviet Union opening US relations with China overthrowing a democratically elected leader and redrawing the borders of several countries After leaving office he went on to offer geopolitical consulting to scores of undisclosed international leaders with his Kissinger Associates consulting firm\n","Even 100 years after he was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger to a Jewish family in the Bavarian city of Frth Kissinger is seen as an international foreign policy heavyweight and contributes his views on geopolitical issues\n","He has often warned of the dangers artificial intelligence pose for the world Putting AI into the same league as the danger from nuclear weapons he warns his younger peers that this is a totally new problem Quite a warning by a man who has seen it all\n","On Russias fullscale invasion of Ukraine Kissinger created a furor by calling for a negotiated peace in November His appeal came at a point when Ukraines Western allies had only just started substantively ramping up their military assistance to Kyiv \n","While Kissinger argued imminent talks were necessary to avoid another devastating world war Kyiv accused him of appeasing the aggressor\n","Ken Lieberthal who worked with Kissinger on several occasions over the past decades said the centenarian has a clear view of what needs to be done and how to get from here to there Kissingers approach requires an unsentimental assessment of capabilities Lieberthal explained A devoted proponent of Realpolitik Kissinger himself described his thinking about conflict in an even more straightforward manner the ends justify the means\n","Ukraines criticism leaves Kissinger unfazed When it comes to dealing with Russia Kissinger who masterminded Americas dtente policy in the 70s can point to having been at the edge of war with Russia himself Later he described detente as a strategy for conducting the conflict with the Soviet Union that bought both sides time for diplomacy and avoiding a hot conflict\n","In a rare change of mind he now backs Ukraines future membership in NATO after he concluded that the idea of a neutral Ukraine in these conditions was no longer meaningful\n","But his willingness to see principles of international law and human rights not as paramount but simply one factor in his policy equations has human rights advocates around the world on edge as soon as they hear his name US Senator Bernie Sanders a leader of Americas political Left said he was proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend calling him the most destructive secretary of state in modern history over his policies in Asia in the 1970s\n","Kissinger has described his often controversial take on strategic leadership as traversing a tightrope that is suspended between the relative certainties of the past and the ambiguities of the future\n","Kissinger has written extensively on his decisionmaking process It saw him initially hide the bombing of Cambodia from the US public The US aimed to defeat the Viet Cong there but ended up enabling the murderous rise of the Khmer Rouge which is estimated to have killed more than 2 million people He had aimed to secure a ceasefire that would end the Vietnam War  Both he and his North Vietnamese counterpart Le Duc Tho were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their plan Only Kissinger accepted the award and he tried to return the Prize when the attempt at a negotiated peace spectacularly failed with the fall of Saigon Decisions he took along the way cost tens of thousands of lives in Vietnam Cambodia and neighboring Laos \n","Whenever Kissinger speaks publicly which he still does to this day there is no doubt that he is aware and unafraid of the grave consequences action entails National Archive documents from the 70s released 40 years later proved that he pressed Nixon into overthrowing the democratically elected President Salvador Allende in 1973 because he felt Chiles model effect can be insidious for US interest in the region By doing so Kissinger effectively enabled the rise of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet whose government killed and tortured thousands of people \n","He always thought in terms of a kind of balance of power Lieberthal said of Kissingers support for interventions in what should have been democratic processes\n","According to Lieberthal Kissinger was driven by the calculation that dominance by one country would produce efforts by others Avoiding the instability such a chain reaction could produce led Kissinger to broker Nixons historic recognition of China in 1972 a policy that continues to bind the US to a commitment that Taiwan is part of China \n","The tensions currently playing out in the Taiwan Strait and the fear of a war over Taiwan mark the extension of  Kissingers US foreign policy leadership from the 70s into the present day Kissinger can claim to have recognized the trajectory of China toward a global power and systemic rival decades ahead of most of his peers\n","While Kissinger celebrates his 100th birthday on Saturday

wanted to be at home and be normal\n","Home was a villa near Ksnacht on Lake Zurich where she had lived since the 1990s The over oneacre estate in Switzerland which she named Algonquin after her

ill in her later years of life She survived a stroke suffered from colon cancer and received a kidney transplant The organ was donated by her husband in 2017 but before that she had been dependent on

tells you what you did right and what you did wrong she told German weekly Die Zeit in 2018 Turner was convinced that every deceased person begins a new life at some point We go and take a break And then we come back  and start over again she believed It was at her secluded home in Switzerland where the songstress reportedly passed away aged 83 \n","If she was right she certainly deserves an easy start in her next life in reincarnation Born on November 26 1939 as Anna Mae Bullock she grew up on a farm in the small town of Nutbush Tennessee where her father worked as an overseer of cotton pickers Racial segregation still prevailed in the US and as a child she had to lower her glance when speaking to a white man Yes Sir no Sir was the expected way of speaking On Sundays Anna Mae sang in the church gospel choir\n","In 1955 she moved to St Louis where her encounter with Ike Turner a pioneer of soul music was to change her life The two met in a club where the then already popular Ike was holding court with his band Kings of Rhythm The then 17yearold Anna Mae spontaneously grabbed the mike and sang a BB King hit It was the beginning of an unprecedented career Ike hired her right away as a background singer for his band\n","She got her big opportunity in 1960 when Art Lassiter the lead singer of the Ike Turner Band was supposed to record the song A Fool in Love But he failed to show so Ike sent the young Anna Mae to the microphone instead It was their very first hit ever which made it to number 27 in the US charts For promotion reasons Ike renamed the young singer Tina without further ado finally pulling her out of the background choir and placing her in the spotlight From then on they toured the country together as the Ike  Tina Turner Revue\n","Ike and Tina also

face and just 36 cents to her name and never returned In the divorce she renounced all rights and joint property only taking her stage name with her A name that would later bring her world fame\n","But at first Tina had a hard time keeping her head above water She was in debt due to the cancelled tour with Ike who took all the royalties She sang in bars and at business events and also worked as a cleaning lady To be free  well that was wonderful I didnt care that I didnt have any money that I had to clean other peoples houses to earn a living she later recalled of this challenging period\n","The big record companies had written her off at that time as an old star who could hardly be marketed But music producer and manager Roger Davies supported Tina He believed in her and

Diversity Day: How inclusive is the cultural world? 23.05.2023 ****'\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Disabilities are multifaceted From psychological to physical disabilities there are many variations In film television and the arts people with disabilities have become increasingly present in recent years and many artists who have a disability themselves are now open about it\n","From Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage who has achondroplasia a genetic disorder that affects bone growth to pop icon Billie Eilish who has Tourettes syndrome to painter Yayoi Kusama who lives with obsessivecompulsive disorder  more and more famous actors artists and musicians with physical or cognitive challenges are garnering space in the spotlight\n","In Germany too things are changing in the cultural world Jutta Schubert a project manager at Eucrea an association focusing on art and artists with disabilities in Germanspeaking countries sees some progress She notes that diversity today is no longer limited to people with a migration background or peoples sexual orientation but also includes people with disabilities\n","In Germany people with disabilities were completely forgotten or overlooked for a very long time Schubert told DW Part of the reason she says is that most federal funding programs for cultural institutions focused on other groups People with disabilities have really only been at the center of the diversity issue for I would say one or two years\n","Today she says it is clear from calls for bids for artistic projects such as those of the Performing Arts Fund or the German Federal Cultural Foundation that the issue of diversity is being perceived more comprehensively\n","Institutions understand that they can secure financial support if they hire people with disabilities or promote accessibility Schubert explains\n","A new program called pik was recently launched by the German Federal Cultural Foundation with the specific aim of promoting projects in this area It aims to facilitate longterm collaborations between theaters and inclusive groups and also includes a mentoring program Such a development would have been unfathomable eight or ten years ago Schubert explains\n","In addition more and more cultural institutions are taking their own initiative in the area especially in the theater sector Schubert referred to the Munich Kammerspiele theater company whose ensemble includes six people with disabilities Other theaters are also showing interest in hiring people with disabilities for productions or even employing them permanently and integrating them into the ensemble\n","\n","The film industry is also paying more attention to diversity To generate realistic portrayals German production companies such as UFA are now using actors with disabilities In doing so they are referring to the EU Platform of Diversity Charters created in 2010\n","When German production companies look for actresses or actors for roles that portray for example a person in a wheelchair with a migration background or someone with brittle bone disease more attention is paid to not casting with actors without disabilities\n","The German film industry has been inspired by developments in the US where actors such as RJ Mitte from Breaking Bad and Peter Dinklage Game of Thrones  have made careers for themselves \n","\n","Even if they do not act as activists for people with disabilities Schubert considers them role models Peter Dinklage speaks very openly about his disability and also sometimes expresses himself in interviews about what changes need to happen According to Schubert this openness has a positive influence on the acceptance of people with disabilities in general society\n","Apart from the theater and film industries the museum landscape is also undergoing change The 2017 exhibition Art and Alphabet at Hamburgs Kunsthalle is one example It showcased the work of Harald Stoffers a successful Hamburg painter with a cognitive disability This painter who works exclusively with writing designed an entire room there says Schubert\n","A special award was created in Germany in 2000 for people with cognitive disabilities who create art The Augustinum Foundation bestows the Euward  a madeup word combining Europe and award  every three years to European artists The three honorees receive among other things an exhibition of their work at the Haus der Kunst in Munich which gives their work visibility This year an Euward will be awarded again\n","One of the biggest hurdles for people with disabilities is getting into the arts and culture business at all For drama schools disabilities were an exclusion criterion until a few years ago says Schubert\n","\n","But the schools are becoming more and more open she adds The association she works for has initiated its own program to promote inclusion in arts education So far universities with visual and performing arts programs from five German states are participating In 2024 the program is to be expanded to other German states\n","When Schubert compares all the inclusion efforts in the cultural sector that have been undertaken in Germany in recent years with those in neighboring countries or even in Great Britain she nevertheless concludes that there is still a great deal of catching up to do in this country\n","This article was originally written in German \n","\n","\n","\"*** Five lessons from Meron Mendel's 'Talking about Israel' 15.05.2023 ****\"\n","Meron Mendels new book ber Israel reden Talking about Israel examines how Israel is debated in Germany \n","A descendant of Holocaust survivors Mendel was born in 1976 and grew up on a kibbutz in Israel He emigrated to Germany in 2003 Since 2010 he has been the director of the Anne Frank Educational Center in Frankfurt\n","Here are five ideas from his book\n","In his new book Mendel analyzes various debates and controversies about representations of Israel in Germany \n","For example he revisits the controversy around Cameroonian historian and political scientist Achille Mbembe who was invited to open the Ruhrtriennale music and arts festival in western Germany in 2020 but whose keynote was canceled when he compared the state of Israel with South Africas apartheid regime \n","Other debates that are analyzed in the book include the German Bundestags resolution against the antiIsrael Boycott Divest Sanction BDS movement in 2019 and the scandal surrounding antisemitic art displayed at the international Documenta art show in 2022\n","Mendel describes how he as an Israeli and a Jew has been used as a tool for very different purposes In Germany he writes the focus is taking a stance on Israelrelated issues as opposed to a nuanced conversation  or even critically questioning ones own stance\n","Every Germans position on the IsraelPalestine question is an identityforming question par excellence It comes before any other discussion virtually as a kind of psychological test he says\n","\n","Mendel asks how the antisemitic representations at Documenta could be better recognized and discussed rather than just scandalized He feels there should have been more space for debate and differentiated perspectives in reaction to the controversy Without this approach he fears the same story will repeat itself in a similar setting \n","Mendel portrays his own experiences throughout the book Having emphasized that antisemitism in Germany is not merely a Muslim issue he has become the target of proIsrael groups who accuse him of relativizing Muslim antisemitism Some have described Mendel as a notorious antisemitism denier\n","His criticisms of Israeli policies have not been wellreceived either \n","While Mendel remembers his friendly welcome when arriving in Germany over two decades ago he recalls that When it became clear that I was much more critical about current politics in Israel and discussed that in my view the Muslim minority is not the main threat to Jews in Germany I was instantly declared an enemy\n","Mendel criticizes this blackandwhite thinking where you can either be for or against Israel For him instead of trying to determine which side is right or wrong a more central question should be trying to determine how moderate forces from both the Israeli and the Palestinian side can be supported\n","Mendel urges selfreflection as a first measure when questions arise in Germany about Israel and the Middle East conflict\n","For example in the current heated discussion about Israels settlement policy where comparisons with the Nazi regime are sometimes made it seems for many Germans to be a relief to be able to label Jews in an unfamiliar reversed role as perpetrators This he says can allow Germans to distance themselves from their own responsibility without having to deal with it\n","He adds that reversing the roles of the victims and the perpetrators can offer some relief from a German perspective After all the Jews are just as bad as our own ancestors\n","This exoneration strategy which first emerged among rightwing radicals is now also found in welleducated circles of people who see themselves as historically conscious and leftwing Mendel adds \n","As a trained historian Mendel sees comparisons as a natural means of observation and analysis\n","But equating the Shoah and the Nakba  meaning catastrophe in Arabic this is remembered on May 15 the start of the ArabIsrael War in 1948 when some 700000 Palestinians were displaced from their homeland  is not historically tenable says Mendel\n","Behind the claim is the urge to delegitimize the very existence of the state of Israel he argues\n","Mendel repeatedly emphasizes the importance of recognizing the suffering of different victims of violence not least that of Palestinians The call for more empathy toward the other is in itself to be applauded he says But it is significant that it often goes handinhand with a lack of empathy toward Jews who are seen as the privileged others\n","Critics accuse Israel of treating Palestinians with the approach of an imperial colonial state This diminishes the significance of the Shoah as the event leading to the founding of the Israeli state Mendel believes  \n","Empathy is not created by comparing the death toll in Auschwitz to the death toll in the Omaheke desert  when German colonizers massacred local Herero and Nama people in Namibia in the early 1900s in what has been called a genocide \n","According to Mendel such comparisons are based on the desire to normalize the German discourse on Israel to condemn Israel harshly without having to take into account its historic origins In other words to present Israel as just one colonial state among many\n","Other injustices do not have to be understood by way of comparison he says The suffering of other groups or individuals and their commemoration is not affected by the memory of the Holocaust\n","Mendel concludes that German accountability for Israel today could involve taking a clear stand against rightwing extremism even if it occurs in the Israeli cabinet\n","Talking about Israel could become a new German virtue an art of criticizing without negating ones own responsibility he suggests\n","This article was adapted from German

As expected, it performed really well as mentioned earlier, news classification is quite influential with the frequency of certain type of words.\n","- Fine tuned BERT model performed better than unoptimized TFIDF with SVM as classifier but didn't outperform the hyperparameters tuned TFIDF SVC. This is because, our dataset is quite small and the training and validation set was also not quite big to train on. Moreover, we only used a standard batch size, learning rate and very less no of epochs. So our fine-tuned BERT model is no where near its optimum capability, which we can achieve by cross validation of parameters such as batch size, learning rate and epochs.\n","- So, the further recommendation for news classification would be to do cross validation of parameters in pre-trained BERT model. Also, we can experiment with our machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost which are known for their great prediction capability.\n","- Moreover, experimentation with other pretrained models such as bert-large-uncased, bert-large-cased would also be recommended actions further."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#
